Proof that men are sensitive

A woman meets a gorgeous man in a bar. They talk, they connect, and they
end up leaving together. They get back to his place, and as he shows her
around his apartment, she notices that his bedroom is completely packed
with sweet cuddly teddy bears. Hundreds of cute small bears on a
shelf all the way along the floor,  cuddly medium sized ones on a shelf a
little higher, and HUGE enormous  bears on the top shelf along the wall.

The woman is surprised that this guy would have a collection of teddy
bears, especially one that is so extensive, but she decides not to
mention this to him, & is actually quite impressed by his sensitive side. She
turns to him... they kiss......... and then rip each others clothes off and make
hot steamy love.

After an intense night of passion with this sensitive guy, they are
lying there together in the afterglow, the woman rolls over and asks smiling,

"Well, how was it?"
The guy says:... "Help yourself to any prize from the bottom shelf".


Now THIS should bring SOME comment from the Ladies....<G.>....

Bigbazza(Barry)



Sure...AFTER the customary explanations. <G>

Peace,  Wolfie

Betcha there's no comments from the /top/ shelf ladies!

My bitter-half is busy packing a few bags and selecting clothes I'm to hang
in the back of the Suburban in awhile as we prepare to depart early tomorrow
morning for Nashville, TN.  One of our ex-son-in-laws is driving from
Winston-Salem, NC to Nashville to deliver our baby grand-daughter to us
Saturday.  She was 16 years old last month (going on 25) and we invited her
to spend about ten days with us.  Her four siblings are all gone from home
now so we figured she could use some spoiling this summer, her first without
siblings.

We're then going IL to visit a friend who has two days of antiquing planned
for us.  Usually we try to visit him in the Fall when it's cooler to do some
antiquing and visit wineries in both IL and MO.  This time, we'll visit the
MO winery w/o him but suspect he'll ask us to tote a case or two to TX for
him.  We'll antique our way across MO and then drop south just inside OK and
then antique our way home to North Central Texas.  Hopefully, the teenager
won't be too bored.

When we get home, our grand-urchins in Foat Wuth will also come to our house
(girl 17; boy 13).  The two girls are going to join their Gma and torment me
and the grandson endlessly I'm sure.  I've promised to have them at Six
Flags in Arlington, TX one day when it opens and pick them up when it
closes.  It's a long drive  for us to Six Flags but we need to spoil them!
Of course, the peace and quiet while they're at Six Flags is a reward unto
itself...  We'll fly the 16 year old home the end of the month.

If we're recovered by then, we have 6 and 16 year old grandsons in NM we'll
visit in August.  The older five grandkids are on their own now so we see
them when they come to visit us at our home.

My bitter-half and I both use canes now so packing and toting bags can be an
adventure!  Old age ain't for sissies!  We're determined to wear out rather
than rust out!

I envy you the antiquing! Haven't done that on any big scale since my 
husband passed away. Not as much fun alone!

As to having the grandkids ... hope they don't wear you out! My 14 year 
old g'son lives next door and that's fun ... I can send him home if he 
gets too rambunctious! :)

Just remember  boy children age 13 and above have
the brain switch moved from "on" to "OFF".  I have
not figured out why God does this, but She does.
Have been involved in scouting for many years, and
without exception at age 13, give or take a month
or two, God reaches down inside the youthful head
and moves the switch.  My ex, who was also very
active in scouting, agrees with me on the action
and the age.  Her only comment is, "It never seems
to move back to on."

	Man oh man, I wish I'd known about that a little earlier, I live only
2.5 hours from Nashville, and could have driven up to meet you, also.
	Sounds like quite an excursion ahead of you! My mom has taken her life
by the horns as well, now. She had my younger brother's son down for a
week to attend a local tennis camp a couple of weeks ago. They live just
outside of Nashville, so it isn't too far to go to send him home if it
gets to be much trouble, but he's always a perfect gentleman around us,
even calling me "Sir!"
(Now *THAT"S* scary!) 
	She is taking "Aerobics for Seniors" at a local seniors club 3 times a
week, and quilting on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, she has a lady come in to
clean house for her, and on Sundays she gets up early to be at church at
8am with me, so she only gets to sleep in on Saturday mornings, getting
up at the late hour of 8am! She usually has me come over at 9am on
Saturdays for breakfast, then yard work, during which she keeps me
supplied with cold water and lemonade. She may do some traveling after
she gets all the paperwork caught up on the death of my father, but it
seems to be never-ending! More forms in the mail every day! 
	Age is just a state of mind, she says, and she's as active as a woman
20 years younger than her 80 years. Just 7 months ago she was in a
wheelchair, unable to walk without pain, after messing up one of her
hips trying to push my dad in a wheel chair on the thick carpeting in
their house. Now she's going strong, and getting better every day.
	Keep it up, OC, and you and the missus will out live your kids!

Turn $6 into $60,000 in 90 days, GUARANTEED

Postal lottery: Turn $6 into $60,000 in 90 days, GUARANTEED

I found this in a news group and decided to try it. A little while
back, I was browsing through news groups, just like you are now and
came across a message just like this, that said you could make
thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of
$6.00!!!

So I thought yeah right, this must be a scam!!! But like most of us,
I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00
to each of the 6 names and addresses stated in the message. You then
place your own name and address at the bottom of the list at #6 and
post the message in at least 200 news groups. (There are thousands).
No catch, that was it.

So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first. I
thought about trying it. I figured, what have I got to lose except 6
stamps and $6.00, right? So I invested the measly $6.00!!! Guess
what? Within 7 days I started getting money in the mail!!! I was
shocked!!! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept
coming in!!! In my first week, I had made about $25.00. By the end of
the second week, I had made a total of over $1,000.00!!! In the third
week, I had over $10,000.00 and it is still growing!!! This is now my
fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it is
still coming in rapidly!!! It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps!!!
I have spent more than that on the Lottery!!!

Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works!!!
Also, make sure you print a copy of this message now. So you can get
the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you
follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more money
than you thought possible by doing something so easy!!!

Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully!!! (Print it out or
download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come
in!!! It's easy!!! It's legal!!! Your investment is only $6.00 (plus
postage).

IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off!!! It is not illegal!!! ? It is
almost entirely risk free and it really works!!! If all of the
following instructions are adhered to, you will receive
extraordinary dividends!!!

Please note: Follow these directions EXACTLY, and $60,000.00 or more
can be yours in 20 to 90 days!!! This program remains successful
because of the honesty and the integrity of the participants!!!
Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the
instructions.

You will now become part of the mail order business. In this business
your product is not solid or tangible, it is a service. You are in
the business of developing mailing lists. Many large corporations are
happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made
from a mailing list is secondary to the income which is made from
people like you and me asking to be included on your mailing list!!!

Here are the 4 easy steps to success:

Step 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on
each piece of paper.

PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST

Now get 6 U.S. dollar bills and place ONE inside each of the 6 pieces
of paper so the bills will not be seen through the envelopes (to
prevent mail theft). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes
and seal them, you should now have 6 sealed envelopes. Each with a
piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a
$1.00 bill. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!!! YOU ARE REQUESTING A
LEGITIMATE SERVICE AND YOU ARE PAYING FOR IT!!!

Like most of us, I was a little skeptical and a little worried about
the legal aspect of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Postal
Service and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!!!

Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:


S.C.B.
28 Dalrymple Green N.W.
Calgary, A.B. T3A-1Y2
Canada

M. Velazquez
5864 S.W. 8th Place
Gainesville, FL 32607
USA

S.N. Chicago
1070 W.64th St. # 11
LaGrange, Illinois 60525

J. Martin
74 Newbury Dr.
Newmarket, Ontario L3Y 4R3
Canada

C. Rogozinsky
167 Whitecap Place
Saskatoon, SK S7M 5C8
Canada

T. Friesen
478 Stalker Bay
Winnipeg, Mb
R2G 0C8
Canada

Step 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move
the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc.) and add your name
as number 6 on the list.

Step 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this message as
close to what you see as possible. Now, post your amended message to
at least 200 news groups. I think there are close to 24,000 groups!!!
All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money
you make!!! This is perfectly legal!! If you have any doubts, refer
to Title18 sec. 1302 & 1341 of the postal lottery laws. Keep a copy
of these steps for yourself and whenever you need money, you can use
it again.

Please remember that this program remains successful because of the
honesty and the integrity of the participants and by their carefully
adhering to the directions!!!

Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program will
continue and the money that so many others have received will come
your way!!!

Note: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you,
either on your computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send
you. This verifies that you are truly providing a service. Also, it
might be a good Idea to wrap the $1 bills in dark paper to reduce the
risk of mail theft.

So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed,
six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a list
developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list
geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position, you
will be receiving thousands of dollars in cash!!! What an opportunity
for only $6.00!!! ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed
above).

Send it now, add your own name to the list and your in business!!!

DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO A NEWS GROUP!!!

Step 1: You do not need to re-type this entire message to do your own
posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this message and
drag your cursor to the bottom of this message and select copy from
the edit menu. This will copy the entire message into the computer
memory.

Step 2: Open a blank note pad file and place your cursor at the top
of the blank page. From the edit menu select paste. This will paste a
copy of the message into notepad so that you
can add your name to the list.

Step 3: Save your new notepad file as a txt file. If you want to do
your posting in a different setting, you'll always have this file to
go back to.

Step 4: Use Netscape or Internet Explorer and try searching for
various news groups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites,
discussions, etc.)

Step 5: Visit these message boards and post this message as a new
message by highlighting the text of this message from your notepad
and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the subject, this
will be the header that everybody sees as they scroll through the
list of postings in a particular group. Click the post message
button. You've done your first one! Congratulations!!! All You have
to do is jump to different news groups and post away, after you get
the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each news group!

REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWS GROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL
MAKE!!!! (But you have to post a minimum of 200).

That's it!!! You will begin receiving money from around the world
within days!!! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the
large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous,
you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it.

JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT!!!

Now the why part. Out of 200 postings, say you receive only 5 replies
(a very low example). So then you made $5.00 with your name at #6 on
the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who sent you $1.00 make the
minimum 200 postings, each with your name at #5 and only 5 persons
respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for you.
Now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with your name at #4 and
only 5 replies each, you will bring in an additional $125.00!!!! Now,
those 125 persons turn around and post the minimum 200 with your name
at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, you will make an additional
$625.00!!! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons
post a minimum 200 messages with your name at #2 and they each only
receive 5 replies, that just made you $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125
persons will all deliver this message to 200 news groups, If just 5
more reply you will receive $15,625.00!!! All with an original
investment of only $6.00!!! Amazing isn't it!!!! When your name is no
longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the news
groups and send out another $6.00 to the names on the list, putting
your name at number 6 again.

You must realize that thousands of people all over the world are
joining the internet and reading these messages every day!!! Just
like you are now!!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really
works? I'm glad I did!!! People have said, "what if the plan is
played out and no one sends you the money?" So what!!! What are the
chances of that happening, when there are tons of new honest users
and new honest people who are joining the internet and news groups
everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to
50,000 new users, every day!!!

REMEMBER PLAY HONESTLY AND FAIRLY AND THIS WILL REALLY WORK!!!

Health conscious?  There is nothing healthier than a good oggie, a
meal in a bag.<g>  Hang your head in shame.<g>  To deny your family
the  delights of the oggie is unjust and unreasonable punishment.  I
can become more indignant about not producing oggies than I can about
the Iraq fiasco.  Saying Ahhhhhh does not reduce your culpability in
denying your family's favourites. Consider yourself told off.  Do you
realise that in a more sensible age than the present, this would have
been worthy of a 'Letter to the Times'.<vbg>

Gordon and Val,
The first time Eastenders was shown here, my youngest son wanted to
watch it.  So, like a dutiful father I sat through it with him.<g>
Once it  was over, his comment was, "That looks like a good show, what
the hell were they saying?"<g>  Dad had to move into translation mode.
To side-track a little. On my last visit to England, I noticed that
regional accents were fading away and being replaced with some sort of
pseudo South Coast accent.  The older people still had the West
Country burr but the kids seemed to be losing it. Is this general?
  A very good friend of mine, a genuine Devon Dumpling maid told me
that her husband had never heard a Cornish accent. 
 She took him to a place that she remembered well from her child-hood,
which was Marazion.  They went on a tour of St. Michael's Mount, the
home of Lord St.Levan. St. Michael's Mount used to be a small fishing
village separated from the main-land at high tide, and the tours were
conducted by men and women from the village, so the Cornish accent was
very much in evidence.  To her horror, and as she described it, "The
tours are now done by toffee-nosed kids with Oxford accents who don't
know anything about the area."
She felt the guide assigned to her party was particularly obnoxious
and over-bearing so decided to have some fun.  During the tour, the
name of a famous West Country smuggler was mentioned. She raised her
hand, and when she was acknowledged, commented in the broad Devon
accent she can use on occasion, "I knows ee. Ee were my
great-great-grand-father", which he was.  Strangely she said, the
guide was not impressed and merely said, "Quite, madam".
Following the tour, she cornered one of the guides and asked if John
was home. When they asked who John was, she told them it was Lord St.
Leven, and as a child she went out in the race committee boat with him
on regatta nights, knew him quite well and would like to visit if he
was home.  She said the expressions on their faces were a sight to
behold. Unfortunately they had no luck at hearing the true Cornish
accent there.

Bobbie,
I would question the phrase 'proper' Cornish pastie.  I say this
because I've never found one outside of Cornwall or Devon. I've seen
many advertised, but were never the real thing.
Tell me, what are the dimensions of your Cornish pasties, and what are
the ingredients?

Hi Gordon,
Yes, I know the area well.<g> I've sailed across the Sound on many
occasions.  I hope you didn't wave at the sailors.  The reason I
mention this is that in my politically incorrect day someone would
have called out, (knowing they wouldn't be heard), "All the women not
wearing knickers wave".  Then of course we would wave and see the
response.<g>  Of course there was no TV on the ships so we made our
own entertainment, even if juvenile.  I don't think I should mention
how the sea-gulls came into the entertainment, suffice to say we hated
them with a vengeance. 
Did you get up to the Hoe to see where Drake farted around when the
Spanish were running their first tourist cruise to England?  Is the
Barbican still there? Cross over to Cornwall on the Torpoint  ferry,
or is that all history now?  One watering hole was what we called the
'Long Bar', I can't remember the street name now as it was so many
years ago, but I still have photos of a drunken night there with some
of my oppos<good friends>
I think I may have seen some paintings of the old dock-yard. Those
were the days, as an old Chief Petty Officer used to remark, "When the
ships were wood and the men were steel.  To-day we seem to have
reversed the process."

Val,
On my infrequent trips to the UK there are a few things I always
attempt to sample once again.  Clotted cream, Oggies, Scrumpy, draft
bitter and fish and chips.  Other than the oggies which I make myself,
the others are not quite the same in Canada, although I can get most
of them.  The best fish and chips I've had here were from a store run
by a man from Afghanistan who told me he had worked in a fish and chip
shop in England before leaving for Canada.
I've just discovered a source here for Mamade, wow, does that ever
make good marmalade.

One of?     I don't fool around.
Mavis did ask me once if I wanted her to iron my shirts which were
hanging up in the lounge.   I declined. 

I could have a life of ease if I brought her here from her rented house
and married her, and I know she would help to decorate and brighten up
the place.    She would lose her pension supplement and her housing
benefit and I would pay over 200 more Council tax.    I could put half
my savings in her name and save a little income tax.
She would get half my Company pension when I died.

Sounds like a good deal for one of us...  ;-)

I use to put my own sockets in and it's no big deal for an EE, but teh
regulations have to be known, and adhered to.
I had my house re-wired a couple of years ago and paid an electrician
(who was a neighbour), to do it.

I had 40 additional sockets put in!

For the record. I believe that the Iraq invasion was a colossal
political, diplomatic and military blunder.  It would have been far
better, in my estimation to complete the job in Afghanistan.
 If the resources now being wasted in Iraq had been deployed to
Afghanistan, that country may have looked better now than it does.
 America would have retained the world opinion it had achieved and
could grow in stature by assisting in the re-building that sorry land.
*That* would have been something for which to be proud.
 A free Afghanistan would also have been a far better beacon for the
world than the current Iraq situation.  However, it should also be
born in mind that Afghanistan has only been conquered once in its
entire history.
  It seems to me to be the height of stupidity to pursue another war
when the first one isn't brought to a successful conclusion.
Having said that. The Iraq war is now history. It happened. No amount
of rhetoric, back-stabbing, snide comments or slanderous insults is
going to change it.  Live with it, move on, and hope against hope that
*some* good will eventually emerge, bearing in mind that when Iraq was
first formed as a country it took something like 20 years to lick it
into shape, and even then was not 100% successful.
 To those who blather on about *peace* in the world, in my 67 years on
this sorry excuse for a civilized planet, I do not recall one year in
which there was peace throughout the world, there was always some spat
going on somewhere. 
 My brother made an interesting comment during my last visit to
England. He had spent over 20 years in the British army and said that
since the Battle of Waterloo, the British army has had one year in
that time-span when it has not been in action somewhere in the world .
If this is true, and frankly I don't have the time or inclination to
check it out, then the American record, which keeps cropping up, fades
into insignificance.

That's my rant for the day. Not that it will do any good.<g>

Men, whatever they look like, who find all women attractive, are much
more attractive to me (as long as they keep their hands to themselves)
than handsome jerks who can't be bothered with anyone who isn't a
perfect "10".

I did try wearing foundation for a while, but I found that the area over
my upper lip always looked as though I hadn't put any makeup on that
spot.  It looked weird, so I decided to save the cost and trouble of
using the foundation.

No doubt there is a lot of tugging back and forth.  

However I think the URL's I provided, from official gov. sources,
http://usinfo.state.gov , covers most to the questions. 

You will have to decide for yourself which is accurate.

Yes, he has been totally immersed in home improvement projects since he

is one of his least favorite things so he has been putting it off.

Can't think of any but Granholm has been a very fast rising political star.
She seems to be doing pretty well at not making people too unhappy in a
terrible situation, bad budget crunch, Republican legislature.  She's very
personable, bright and exudes confidence, a bit softer Hillary perhaps, and
without the Clinton baggage.

Cool. I've learned that Barney Frank is co-sponsoring legislation to begin
to
make this change, Joan, and there seems no real reason not to. It'll take a
while, but maybe Granholm will be a player... Romney [pere]. Who else from
Michigan has been a presidential candidate in the past?               Marian

We used to farm in North Dev0n, our daughter is still there and her partner
is a farmer.  He and his family still speak with a lovely soft Devon accent
with lots of ee's and old fashioned country language.  I hope country
accents won't die out, we will be poorer without them I fear.

I agree wholeheartedly with what you said, Jan. But in my estimation
the bickering isn't over Iraq only .. it's the clash of two
irreconcilable ideologies. 

One is liberal, multilateral, internationalist,  the other is
conservative (in a harsher sense than what we are used to in Canada)
and unilateral and nationalistic. We thought the latter had seen its
day and were surprised to see it surface in such a virulent form.
Maybe 9/11 did it .. it's MY only explanation for the sudden eagerness
to solve all problems, no matter how complicated, by force.

Paul

Farm made clotted cream is to die for Mmmmmm!  Now I wouldn't touch Marmade

demerra sugar and chunks of crystallised ginger - it tastes great :)

I love spy thrillahs, and this one is for real...He is critical of all parties
in this mess.        Marian

http://www.iht.com/articles/113364.htm 

Secrets of a spy scandal ~ Nicholas D. Kristof of the NYT ~ 10/13/03 

Like any good spy story, the Valerie Plame Wilson affair is far more complex
than it seems on the surface. I know Mrs. Wilson, but I knew nothing about her
CIA career and hadn't realized she's "a hell of a shot with an AK-47," as a
classmate at the CIA training "farm," Jim Marcinkowski, recalls.

I'll be more careful around her, for she also turns out to be skilled in 
throwing hand grenades and to have run covert operations in some of the 
world's messier spots. She was not a source for this column.

Her operations remain secret, but there are several crucial facts that 
can be made public without putting anyone at risk - and together, they 
leave everybody looking bad. The CIA is conducting a damage assessment, 
which will determine what networks and operations it will have to close 
down. But my sense is that Democrats exaggerate the damage to Wilson's 
career and to her personal security, while Republicans vastly play down 
the enormity of the security breach and the danger to the assets she 
worked with.

And now a few pertinent facts:

First, the CIA suspected that Aldrich Ames had given Wilson's name to 
the Russians before his arrest for espionage in 1994. So her undercover 
security was undermined at that time and she was brought back to 
Washington for safety reasons.

Second, as Wilson rose in the agency, she was already in transition away 
from undercover work to management, and to liaison roles with other 
intelligence agencies. So this year, even before she was outed, she was 
moving away from "noc" - which means non-official cover, like pretending 
to be a business executive. After passing as an energy analyst for 
Brewster-Jennings Associates, a CIA front company, she was switching to 
a new cover as a State Department official, affording her diplomatic 
protection without having "CIA" stamped on her forehead.

Third, Wilson's intelligence connections became known a bit in 
Washington as she rose in the CIA and moved to State Department cover, 
but her job remained a closely held secret. Even her classmates in the 
CIA's career training program mostly knew her only as Valerie P. That 
way, if one spook defected, the damage would be limited.

All in all, I think the Democrats are engaging in hyperbole when they 
describe the White House as having put Wilson's life in danger and 
destroyed her career; her days skulking in the back alleys of cities 
like Beirut and Algiers were already mostly over.

If Democrats have politicized the scandal and exaggerated it, 
Republicans have inexcusably tried to whitewash it. The leak risked the 
security of all operatives ever seen with Wilson. Unwitting sources will 
now realize that they were supplying the CIA with information, and even 
real agents may fear exposure and vanish.

CIA veterans are seething, and rightly so, at the betrayal by their own 
government. Larry Johnson, who entered the agency at the same time as 
Wilson, is a Republican who voted for President George W. Bush - and 
he's so enraged that he compares the administration leaker to the spies 
Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen.

"Here's a woman who put her life on the line," Johnson said. "But unlike 
a Navy Seal or a Marine, she didn't have a gun to fight back. All she 
had to protect her was her cover."

We in journalism are also wrong, I think, to extend professional 
courtesy to Robert Novak, by looking beyond him to the leaker. True, he 
says he didn't think anyone would be endangered. Working abroad in ugly 
corners of the world, American journalists often learn the identities of 
American CIA officers, but we never publish their names.

I find Novak's decision to do so just as inexcusable as the decision of 
administration officials to leak it.

This scandal leaves everybody stinking.

=============
As you say, it's important to read a wide variety of sites in order to get
the whole
story and thus develop a fully informed opinion. To just read gov't sites
and form
an opinion from that is not to get the whole story, and gov't, any gov't
tends to
only offer information which supports their policy.

It sounds like having a sexy friend but maintaining your own residences
is the best option. That's my choice as well.

===============
Doesn't it get humid where you live? If you don't iron, you must wear
synthetics, like I do in winter. I don't like ironing which is why I have
this special system of hanging clothes on the hoist, so they come out
looking almost ironed and only need a minor touch up before I put
them on. As I said, I get a heat rash if I wear a synthetic when it's
hot and humid.

Granholm sounds excellent. First term? Would make an excellent veep choice in

===========
I find they look a bit better when they've had an iron to touch them
up. However, that's only for the ones I wear when I'm going out.
I do NOT iron the ones I wear around the house. Suti, Sasha and
my friends don't mind a wrinkle or two.<g> You should see the
procedure I have when I hang up clothes so that they dry and
look mostly ironed. My next door neighbour laughs when she
sees my 'ironing on the line' methods...but they work.<g>

I made a list of electrical work I wanted done then called my electrician
and he put in the whole lot at once. That included 2 extra outside power
points and a green spotlight which shines on the pond at night.

Quite so, Paul

Sinclair has left for Oz. On Thursday I leave for France for a month. Should be
a respite in 'bickering' threads for a time...
Y'all will have to find your *own* articles.

===========
Aside from winter, the towels become soft anyway, due to the
humidity. Dryers really use electricity. All our appliances here
have an energy rating, stars from one to 6. Most of my appliances
have 5-6. Even my air con has  4. I have a dryer which is almost
an antique so it doesn't have an energy rating, but my neighbour
just bought a new one and the energy rating is 1. In other words,
it uses a lot of electricity.

I have $70/month automatically debited to Energex. I'm $147 in
the black at present. It is usually used up in summer with the air
con. However, if I don't use it all by next March, I may cut the
monthly debit down to $60-65/month, since I now have solar
Hart so don't pay anything for my hot water anymore.

I have the same problem with extremely dry skin in winter. It's
a lot better in summer with the humidity. I use moisturising
cleansers and moisturisers religiously as well.

=========
I must check that out next time I put some foundation on. I use such
a teeny amount when I do use it that I'm not even sure it shows. I've
had the same small jar of foundation for 4 years so I obviously
don't wear much...or very often.

You're spot on, Marian. Target here is owned by Myers now, a big Aussie
department store, etc. Target has many of the same items as Myers but
they're less expensive.

Bobbiewrote:  "It's interesting how different people feel comfortable in
different clothes. I wear trackies(sweats) at home in winter, until I go
out. It's still a bit chilly this morning and I am wearing my trackies.
Capri pants are pedal pusher length, aren't they? That's what I wear in
summer when I go out. Elastic waists are indeed comfortable. I wear
stretch jeans so the waist expands in them. I find the slacks which
don't have elastic waist bands uncomfortable."
****************************************
I wear pants with elastic in the waist.  I don't like blue jeans because
they feel to constricting.  I have a couple of pairs of pedal pushers,
now called "capri pants".
In my heyday,  capri pants fitted closer to the legs.   I call them
pedal pushers because they are a little looser in the leg.
Abut the elasticized wists in pants, I usually sit down and rip out the
elastic from the front, stitch securely and voila, my tummie has
breathing room.  Some pants even in the same sizes, have uncomfortable
waistlines and ripping out the elastic from the front makes them much
more comfortable.  I can't stand anything too tight around my waist.

Back from the dead? I loved Den. Grieved when he died. Lose it? Why? We're
seeing it [2 episodes] at 11:00 pm on Sunday nights, and 4 years behind...How
could PBS get away with that?     Marian

I have a gas dryer, of course it uses electricity to turn the drum but
that's nowhere near what it takes to produce the heat.  I don't use it a
whole lot, though as it's only a few things that I put in the dryer.

Aside from winter, the towels become soft anyway, due to the
humidity. Dryers really use electricity. All our appliances here
have an energy rating, stars from one to 6. Most of my appliances
have 5-6. Even my air con has  4. I have a dryer which is almost
an antique so it doesn't have an energy rating, but my neighbour
just bought a new one and the energy rating is 1. In other words,
it uses a lot of electricity.

I have $70/month automatically debited to Energex. I'm $147 in
the black at present. It is usually used up in summer with the air
con. However, if I don't use it all by next March, I may cut the
monthly debit down to $60-65/month, since I now have solar
Hart so don't pay anything for my hot water anymore.

Add Neil Lewis of the NYTimes to that list. He was on the NewsHour tonight
after a recent visit to Guantanamo... Red Cross is complaining of the mental
condition of the prisoners after such a long time. Many suicide attempts, much
depression...

Bobbie responded to my comment about the little slogan about women:  "I
have a saying I found once, back in the 70/80's I think: "Whatever women
do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good.
Luckily, this is not difficult." I stuck this to my bulletin board over
my desk and memorized it. I guess that is why women are expected to do
twice as much work as men and why the "glass ceiling" still exists! -
Salary cap. =A0 Women usually do a better job than men in some
professions, or at least as well as, but the "glass ceiling" hits them
in the head as far as salary and/or promotion. Jeanette 
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 
Good assessment.....We have a problem with the glass ceiling here
as well. 
Bobbie"
****************************************
Whenever my boss came into my office, he scowled at the saying.  I asked
him if he was going to make me take it down but he said no, but that is
was sexist.  He continued scowling every time he came in my office.
After about a year, I got a different desk with different overhead
cabinets, so I stuck it to the inside of one of the cabinet doors.  I
don't think he even realized it was gone!  Today I have a secretary
style desk with a drop-down leaf and I keep it stuck in there.  Jeanette

===========
It's about the size of a side plate lengthwise, a proper triangle.
Ingredients: chopped steak, potato, turnip, leeks. It looks
totally different and tastes totally different than the other
pasties sold here. The baker is from Cornwall and has the
accent to match, so I assume it's the real thing. It certainly
tastes and looks the same as the Cornish pasties I had when
in Cornwall.

Yes, people either love Hillary or hate her, seems no middle ground.  She
really is very popular with a lot of people, her book sold very well and
when you match her up against Bush in the polls she comes out ahead.

Jennifer Granholm was just elected last November, she was Attorney General
before that.  Replaced a Republican who decimated state services such as
mental health care. Pretty hard to rebuild those things now with the revenue
picture so bad.

'08, for sure~if she can get re-elected for a second... There is SO much

a Senate career into her dotage. Hate the thought of how ugly it could

Well, they aren't in the North!     I have a definite
Lancashire/Manchester accent.   I only went to Cornwall once on a
Plymouth coach holiday, when we had a day excursion to Looe.   Our
driver for the five days had a broad Cornish accent, and we called at a
place where we were given a welcome in Cornish language by a lady.

You got that right, Gordon.  I cquired my first clothes dryer shortly
before my second child was born.  That was 46 years ago and I haven't
been without one since.  Te only things I like dried on the line are
sheets, but usually didn't have the time to hang them out, what with
working full time and taking care of the house and babies.  Jeanette

Sasha is a German Shepherd.....my beautiful, intelligent and loyal
dog. For sure, you wouldn't get past her unless I let her know
it was OK. Needless to say, the people who come to the door
to try to sell me something don't stay long. Sasha can sense my
feelings, then gives that low German Shepherd growl with teeth
bared and ruff up. They decide they might prefer to go to
another house.<g> Of course, as soon as they leave, she's back
to being my sweet Sasha.<g>

I don't envy *any* Governor her job in these times. Every other Executive sent
money back to the states when times were bad, but not this one. I don't know
what will happen. Hope Granholm survives it.

Using foundation should help protect your skin from the elements.  We live
by the sea and it can get rather windy at times so I wear foundation which
helps to prevent little thread veins which can appear on fine skin like
mine.  I also stay outt of the fierce sun as much as possible

Yes, it's very humid here in the summer [6 months at least], and no, I don't
wear synthetics. Ever. If the wrinkles don't fall out, I wear them innaway.

Ours are energy rated, but I can't remember what the dryer is.
It is only a small one, and the rating is reasonable, I think.

Last year, Electricity cost me 236, and gas cost 226.
Monthly equivs are 19.66 and 18.83 respectively.
I pay bills at the end of the quarter.
I don't believe in leaving money in the Utilities bank account instead
of mine in summer.....
I could reduce the charges by going monthly DD, but it just about
offsets the advantage of the quarterly credit.

Gas fired central heating and hot water via Combi boiler.
Electric cooker and electric shower.

Clockwork computer.  :-)

I think it is, and I agree with him. I haven't studied economics, and I'm aware
of how little I know. That's the difference between us, Bob.

Since I stay at my daughter's and take most meals at her house, I don't know
this from personal experience but I've read, heard from several quarters that
Paris is a *lot* cheaper than London.     Marian

In her early life, throughout it really, M****, because of her looks,
attracted the kind of fools who rush in when the nice guys hesitate, and
made some bad mistakes. 

I know I don't really do myself any favours on usenet with some of my
postings, but I can't resist the chance to try to make someone smile.
I am very nervous about making first moves, the exceptions being with my
wife and with M****.    A kiss isn't a heavy first move, is it?     ;-)
I don't touch, except the woman I'm with.   There are three women at the
dancing who have touched me, two only my hand or arm, more a habit of
theirs than anything else.  One was so persistent that I told her gently
that M**** might take a dim view if she noticed.....  There's another
old dear who always rubs my back when I dance with her, but she does it
with quite a few men.
I think she is a widow who enjoys the warmth of a man's arms and returns
the warmth.  Good job she doesn't know the effect it has on me! 

What makes people touchers?  Why does a woman touch a man's arm
virtually every time she speaks to him.
Are there men who are habitual (non-sexual) touchers?
I wouldn't know that, of course.    ;-)

I'm worse than most!    Actually, it was after I had trailed round the
shops with M****, waiting while she tried 3 bras on, and examined the
stitching on every garment in Debenhams, that we were walking past the
Urban Man's Shop.    She spotted a shirt in the window and said "find
out how much it is", but when I went inside there were so many I liked
that I decided I'd go back again when we had more time for a proper
look.

Yes indeed, and there's a street where there are coins embedded firmly

There is a new bridge now, or was going to be one built, I can't
remember now.   We went to Dartmouth where we met a guy I used to work
with and his wife for lunch, and we had coach trips to Looe, Totnes, and
Whatsthenameofthat Abbey.

I Googled.......

Meaning  
    Partners engaged in sexual intercourse.  
  Origin 
    This modern sounding phrase is in fact at least as early as
Shakespeare. From Othello. Iago: 'I am one, sir, that comes to tell you
your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs'.

I have noticed that dogs which are owned by women are very ready to
protect their mistress at the least imagined sign of threat, much more
so than with a male owner.

Jean and I were walking one day in a remote place when we met a girl
with a medium sized dog.   It was quite happy with Jean talking to her,
but I could see that it was becoming very 'interested' in me, and she
had to restrain it.

Yes dear, it had pretty stripes.
(reading the sentence sideways).

It is expensive by my standards, yes.  The last shirt I bought cost me a
fiver.    This would be for dancing.  There were some inside which were
40, which I'd like M****'s opinion on, but she waited outside the shop.
(The time was up on her car park ticket).

I think there are - some people do a lot of touching, some do none at
all.  People can change in that regard, to a certain extent at least.  I
used to be pretty touch-me-not, and then I got in with a couple of
groups who do a lot of strictly friendly hugging.  I found I really
liked that.  I still seldom initiate a hug, except with family and close
friends, but I do enjoy being hugged.

OTOH, it bothers me when people (men or women) stand too close when
they're talking to me.  I feel as though my personal space is being
invaded.  Some people seem to feel a need to stand very close to, and/or
touch the person they are speaking to.  In most cases, I think it's just
an innate personality trait.

===========
You are right about dogs owned by women being very protective.
A dog squad mate actually chose Sasha for me. He said I should
have a female dog, he checked out both parents, etc. Sasha is very
cluey as to people.....she growls at con artists and angry people, be
they men or women. I reckon she's a good judge of character.

Bobbie responded to my comment about the little slogan about women:  "I
have a saying I found once, back in the 70/80's I think: "Whatever women
do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good.
Luckily, this is not difficult." I stuck this to my bulletin board over
my desk and memorized it. I guess that is why women are expected to do
twice as much work as men and why the "glass ceiling" still exists! -
Salary cap. Women usually do a better job than men in some
professions, or at least as well as, but the "glass ceiling" hits them
in the head as far as salary and/or promotion. Jeanette
==============
Good assessment.....We have a problem with the glass ceiling here
as well.
Bobbie"
****************************************
Whenever my boss came into my office, he scowled at the saying.  I asked
him if he was going to make me take it down but he said no, but that is
was sexist.  He continued scowling every time he came in my office.
After about a year, I got a different desk with different overhead
cabinets, so I stuck it to the inside of one of the cabinet doors.  I
don't think he even realized it was gone!  Today I have a secretary
style desk with a drop-down leaf and I keep it stuck in there.  Jeanette
=======
I had that saying stuck on to my filing cabinet as well. I only got
comments and scowls from one man, and he had power and
control issues,.....and continual female problems...couldn't keep
a relationship for more than 6 months. Very telling, eh?

True. I had my hair cut yesterday, so my head feels a lot lighter
and my fringe is no longer in my eyes. It's given me a lift. I always
go on a Tues as that's the day the haircuts are cheaper...$13.
Now I have to colour it again.

I don't like elastic digging into my waist either. I'm wearing jeans

I usually use a moisturiser made for Aussie conditions....wind, sun,

Which part of North Devon Val?  I spent several years working out of
Barnstaple, with North Devon as my territory before I emigrated.  Used
to cover from Porlock down past Clovelly and Hartland Point then a
sweep inland.

Bobbie,
Close enough. Consider yourself among the lucky ones.  The times I've
been offered Cornish pasties they have been made with minced beef and
are so small they needed all the extra trimmings, potato etc. just to
make a meal.  I wish I could find one here, then I'd not have to cook
them myself.<g>

Now that type of holiday has much to commend it. Adds a whole new
meaning to the phrase 'sight-seeing'.<g>  However, all the more reason
not to wave at the sailors.<g>

Well me dear Oi'm real glad to 'ear  that.  It was mainly with the
kids I noticed it.  Or maybe my ear for the dialect has faded
somewhat.<g>  My own accent is  definitely West Country, now overlaid
with Canadian, or so I'm told.

========
I tend to be a platonic toucher, when I know the person, but am
cautious with those I don't know as many people don't feel
comfortable being touched. I tend to be more touchy-feely
with women than men, because with women friends it's
non-sexual, with men......well.......<g>

=============
I feel it's very important to keep abreast of what has happened, what
is happening. I agree with you about Afghanistan and not Iraq. Of
course, the invasion and occupation of Iraq was essentially for
empire building and to usurp Iraq's oil and economy.

IMO, the situation in Iraq, the UN's decisions, etc are very
important for the world, which is why there is so much focus
on it. How it goes will make a difference between the Bush
regime attempting to gain dictatorial control of the world vs
the US being a part of the world and working in cooperation
with the world as they always have in the past. I appreciate
the articles which are posted here and appreciate debate,
but not personal attacks and abuse.

I don't feel that just because we're older we should
dissociate ourself from what is happening in the international
arena since it will affect all of us, and most especially our
children and our children's children.

I agree with you Paul and am both surprised and shocked by the rise
in unilateral, nationalistic thinking and the focus on use of force to
solve all problems. In reality, this use of force is causing more
problems.

I think it has a lot to do with upbringing.  Some families are touchers,
others are very reserved.

In her early life, throughout it really, M****, because of her looks,
attracted the kind of fools who rush in when the nice guys hesitate, and
made some bad mistakes.

I know I don't really do myself any favours on usenet with some of my
postings, but I can't resist the chance to try to make someone smile.
I am very nervous about making first moves, the exceptions being with my
wife and with M****.    A kiss isn't a heavy first move, is it?     ;-)
I don't touch, except the woman I'm with.   There are three women at the
dancing who have touched me, two only my hand or arm, more a habit of
theirs than anything else.  One was so persistent that I told her gently
that M**** might take a dim view if she noticed.....  There's another
old dear who always rubs my back when I dance with her, but she does it
with quite a few men.
I think she is a widow who enjoys the warmth of a man's arms and returns
the warmth.  Good job she doesn't know the effect it has on me!

What makes people touchers?  Why does a woman touch a man's arm
virtually every time she speaks to him.
Are there men who are habitual (non-sexual) touchers?
I wouldn't know that, of course.    ;-)

"Army probes soldier suicides:
Alarmed by the number of suicides among soldiers in Iraq, the Army has asked
a team of doctors to determine whether the stress of combat and long
deployments is contributing to the deaths. In the past seven months, at
least 11 soldiers and three Marines have committed suicide in Iraq, military
officials say. That is an annual rate of 17 per 100,000.The numbers suggest
the rate in Iraq is above normal."

This contrasts with this propaganda stunt:
"Many soldiers, same letter. Newspapers around U.S. get identical missives
from Iraq. They appear to be part of a campaign to present a positive
picture of US occupation."

==========
My friends and I hugs each other as do my family and I.
I do understand your need for personal space and feeling
invaded when people stand too close. Having lived in the
outback and then in country Queensland for years, I have
quite a need for personal space as well. I move back and
if the person moves forward, I say that I feel more comfortable
at 'this distance' and explain why. Big city people tend to need
less personal space than country people. It's always wise to
be aware of people's personal space levels.

Very true. My Dad was more of a toucher than Mum who was brought

  Interesting concept Paul, however, I see the reactions as being
caused simply by fear.   Remember that until 9/11 any attacks on US
and other countries installations were in foreign lands. This could be
reported at supper time on CNN and be greeted with the expected
tut-tutting, in turn to be followed by the evening's 'entertainment'.
  9/11 on the other hand brought the reality of terror activities
right into the States which had some idea that this could never happen
to them. 
   Once this happened there was turmoil.  For those on the left it was
a case of "Why do they hate us so much, we must find out and make them
love us."  While for the right, it was a case of "Let's blow them
away."  Basically the pacifist side driven by the fear that anything
they do may upset someone and make things worse and the aggressive
side driven by the fear that if they don't  do something it will only
get worse. The fore-going is of course greatly simplified.
  When I mentioned this event to my brother who was in ignorance of it
as he happened to be in Portugal at the time. He had seen it on TV in
a bar, but not speaking the language sufficiently well to follow the
report assumed it was advertising a new movie.<g>  His comment to me
was, "Tough, we've lived  with that shit for 30 years."  Thinking
about this seemingly heartless comment, I realised he was right.  This
terrorism thing has been going on for years, but the US was in
isolation from it, so could ignore it.
  Now we come to the complicated bit. I don't believe the States has
the psyche, for want of a better word, for peace-keeping or
peace-making.  The whole attitude, even from the left is to attack,
using any excuse or ammunition available, hence the acrimony and name
calling.  The left attacks the right for doing something, the right
attacks the left and the perceived enemy.  Both going 'gung-ho' at it.
  I don't believe the concept of "Softly, softly, catchee monkey" has
any meaning for them. By them I am referring to the government and the
top military brass who seem incapable of learning from other's
mistakes. 
   As an example of the last. During the days of the Viet-nam war, my
BIL as a member of the SAS went, with a team to Viet-nam to advise the
American military on what to do to win.  This advice was based on
British knowledge, hard-won I might add, in Malaya.  The concept was
the one talked about a great deal now of winning the hearts and minds
of the locals.  The Brit approach in Malaya was one of going to a
village and talking to the head-man.  Telling him they were aware that
the bandits were taking their rice and leaving them hungry and did
they want this to continue, they were not blaming the village for
feeding the communists as the villagers had no choice.  If the village
head-man agreed that he would rather keep the rice for his own people,
then all he was advised to do was send someone, after the bandits had
left, to advise the Brits.  They then pursued the bandits, set up
ambushes and killed them.  Gradually, very gradually, they cleaned up
area after area by this method and had the local people on their side.
The American brass ignored this advice, stating they would do it their
way and promptly destroyed village after village, getting hate from
the villagers instead of assistance.  The bottom line was that the
Brits won in Malaya while the Americans were forced to leave Viet-nam.
  The same thing happened in Afghanistan. I read a report where some
US special forces, working with their Brit counter-parts had subdued
one of the northern areas.  They were on good terms with the locals,
respected their traditions regarding the women and didn't use much
force at all.   The locals then told them where the arms dumps were,
when the Al-quaida or the Taliban were in the area and where.  In
short, full co-operation in return for kindness, respect and medical
treatment for those who needed it.
Then some US paratroops were assigned to the area. The special forces
guys briefed them on what had been going on and that all was quiet,
they offered to accompany the paratroop patrols as they were known to
the locals.  I believe it was a captain in charge of the paras who
said, "I don't need your help, we'll do it my way."  His way was to
kick in doors to search for weapons, even into the women's quarters,
which was a definite no-no.  One of the special force men reported
that, "This arse-hole has undone 6 months of hard work in a few
hours."
  I read another report recently from Iraq which I refrained from
posting because quite frankly it made me sick to read it. (If you are
interested, let me know, I'll either post it here or  send it by
e-mail.)   It seems an American officer, deciding that some local
farmers had not been telling all they knew, ordered the fields and
date-palms bull-dozed in retaliation. (Does this sound familiar?)
 This is heartless and in direct  violation of the Geneva Convention
regarding the treatment of civilians in occupied territories. This
particular officer, if the report is true, should be hauled before the
world court and sentenced.  However, I don't see this happening, but
with this attitude, I can, unfortunately see nothing but disaster
ahead and hope that the British government will withdraw their troops
from this theatre.
  I too am glad that our government did not support this ill-advised
adventure other than the ships we already had in the area.  However, I
do feel that Cretien should have offered moral support and not got
into the Bush bashing that several of his members did.

Sorry this is so long, but one thing seemed to lead naturally to the
next.

Bobbie, I've interspersed my responses to your post as you covered
several areas:

Other than stating, as I have, that I feel the whole adventure was
ill-advised and a blunder, I will not speculate further on the
reasons.  You, of course are entitled to your own opinions. I don't
hate the US, I just think a great mistake was made.  In fact I admire
President Bush for taking action against terrorism. I just question
his methods.

>IMO, the situation in Iraq, the UN's decisions, etc are very

Your faith in the UN is touching. I'm afraid I do not share your faith
in that body doing anything constructive.  Koffi Annan has shown
himself to be weak as far as I'm concerned and not suitable for the
post.   He permitted the genocide in Rwanda.  When he was advised by
the Canadian General on the spot what was happening, he ignored his
pleas for assistance and clearance to take action. As a result,
several Belgian peace-keepers lost their lives. Not to mention about a
million Africans.
   Again, during Gulf War 1, it was the 'glorious' UN that stopped the
pursuit of Saddam's army into Iraq.  That was the time to have ended
Husseins rule once and for all.  Therefor, in my opinion,
responsibility for the current Iraq debacle rests on the shoulders of
the UN, not the US.   
Those clowns at the UN do not seem to get it through their little
liberal heads that war is war and must be ended in one way or another.
A cease fire is not the end. Surely to God, WW1 ending in a cease-fire
and armistice should have taught them something, but obviously it
didn't which makes the blood-shed of that time all the more pathetic.

> I appreciate the articles which are posted here and appreciate debate,
>but not personal attacks and abuse.

You must be one of the few.<g>  Any article I've seen posted here has
been left-wing propaganda posted by Marian.  If Marian had posted her
own thoughts on the subjects that would have been different but she
gives the impression of never having had an original thought pass
through her head.  I agree with you about debate, but I've seen
precious little of it here.  The general tone which I can determine is
one of mud-slinging at the US and President Bush himself.  One cannot
debate a news-paper article either as the writer is not present to
defend their stance.

>I don't feel that just because we're older we should

With three wars, in which I have been a somewhat unwilling
participant, under my belt, I can't get too excited at what happens
elsewhere else in the world.  However, should some country decide to
invade or threaten Canada, I'll be first in line to be armed and I'll
certainly take a few of them with me.  If it's to affect my kids and
grand-kids, they will have to learn to deal with it as I had to.

>From the article
------------------------------
In the past seven months, at least 11 soldiers and three Marines have committed
suicide in Iraq, military officials say. That is an annual rate of 17 per
100,000. The Navy also is investigating one possible suicide. And about a dozen
other Army deaths are under investigation and could include suicides.

The numbers suggest the rate in Iraq is above normal. Last year, the military
services reported 8 to 9 suicides per 100,000 people. The Army rate is usually
higher, 10 to 13 per 100,000. That mirrors the rate for the same age group in
the general population
-------------------------------

The numbers given indicates the suicide rate for the Army has doubled from about
1 per month per 100,000 in normal times to 2 for those stationed in Iraq.

I would be surprised if the suicide rate of Army personal was not higher in Iraq
than it is at home and normal times.

My reading of the article in The Olympian indicates that most of the soldiers
contracted by GNS (GANNETT NEWS SERVICE ) confirmed the content of the letter.

When I post an article, the stance becomes mine own and I will defend it
against all comers. Why should I natter on with a personal, private opinion
when others say what I mean so much better?

Spiraling tragedy. Sharon with his penchant for military solutions certainly
finds boon companions in our Dubya-Cheney, doesn't he? But Sharon isn't only
about military solutions. He was the one who initiated the settler program, and
continues it to this day...   Marian

Yes, it is wise.  Sadly, few people are so aware.  In fact, it seems to
me that most people don't often realize that other people have different
needs from what they have.  I've heard people say, "That wouldn't bother
me, so it shouldn't bother you."  Another of my 'favorites' is "anybody
can afford that", which really means is, "Because of my income and
priorities, I can afford it."

==============
I agree with you 100%. I assume you heard about the peace
plan which Israeli opposition leaders and Palestinians have
been working on.

"Israeli opposition politicians, intellectuals and former Palestinian
ministers have united to propose a peace plan to put an end to years
of bloodshed in the region. Under the proposals, drawn up after two
and a half years of clandestine negotiations, the Palestinians would
give up the right of return for refugees who fled or were forced out
of what is now Israel in 1948. In exchange, a new Palestinian state
would have sovereignty over one of the most fought-over sites in the
world: the Haram al-Sharif, or Temple Mount, sacred to Jews and
Muslims."


I read a number of articles yesterday which discussed the entire plan,
which looks quite good. However, it won't happen as long as Sharon's in
power.
He immediately rejected the plan without even looking at it and said:
"By what right are left-wing people proposing moves that Israel can never
do,
nor will ever do?" Not while he's in power, certainly.

For the complete article:

===========
Excellent analysis! As for the points you made:

* Terrorism has been going on for years, but the US was
 isolated from it, so could ignore it..............................
I feel the big difference was that it was a large terrorist
attack in their country. And the general American attitude
tends to be that they are so strong that nobody would
dare attack their country.

* Driven by fear.....................................................
Instead of calming the fear and encouraging resolution
of the trauma and PTS, the Bush regime used the fear
and shock to institute their propaganda program in order
to increase the fear, trauma and PTS, in order to put in
place the Neo-Con's NPAC plan for empire-building
and world domination by a fascist style dictatorship,
of the world, of the US. As far as I'm concerned,
using the trauma and fear for their mind control
of the US population was a moral crime.

* I don't believe the States has  the psyche for peace-keeping or
peace-making.............................................
I don't either. The psyche has developed into a penchant for
wars, power and control and violence as the answer for
anything. Violence is even the theme of the national anthem:
'rocket's red flare, bombs bursting in the air......' The
emphasis in dealing with other nations has always tended to
be attack, control, blackmail, threaten, coerce. However,
this is by far the worst I have ever seen it. I had hoped
that as the US matured it would drop the frontier mentality
and gain negotiation, diplomacy and as you say, 'Softly,
softly, catchee monkey' skills. But, I don't see any signs
of this happening, and it certainly won't happen while
the wild west cowboy is in office.

* Malaya & the Brits/ Vietnam & the Yanks.............
The differences in approach have been patently obvious
for half a century. The Brits way works, the Yank way
creates more angst, anger and retaliation. I've been
following the situation in Afghanistan closely and I agree
with your assessment there as well. And, as you say,
the same thing is happening in Iraq, and will keep getting
worse as long as the Yanks are determined to occupy
Iraq and usurp their oil and economy. The UN and the
more 'mature' nations are aware of this. Even the less
'mature' nations are aware of this.

* Yank bulldozing of Iraqi date palms in retaliation........
I read that article too and like you was so aghast that
it took me a day to even post it to my epals
around the world. Shades of Nazi Germany. I
evidently deleted it and couldn't find it again. If you
still have it, I think you should post it.

* Involvement in US Iraq war......................
I'm proud of the Canadian government's stand
as well, and ashamed of our participation there.
At least we've withdrawn our troops. I agree
that Britain should as well.

I probably am aware for several reasons.....I'm a psychologist so am
fully aware of nuances, body language, etc, and I'm also intuitive,

Wasn't it his wife?  That was the only episode of the show I ever saw -
the one where they revealed who shot him.

I didn't realize you were a psychologist, but I'm not surprised.  From

I found the article........and it's just as shocking reading it again as it
was the first three times I read it.

Bobbie

********
US soldiers bulldoze farmers' crops
Americans accused of brutal 'punishment' tactics against villagers, while
British are condemned as too soft

US soldiers driving bulldozers, with jazz blaring from loudspeakers, have
uprooted ancient groves of date palms as well as orange and lemon trees in
central Iraq as part of a new policy of collective punishment of farmers who
do not give information about guerrillas attacking US troops. The stumps of
palm trees, some 70 years old, protrude from the brown earth scoured by the
bulldozers beside the road at Dhuluaya, a small town 50 miles north of
Baghdad.

Farmers said that US troops had told them, over a loudspeaker in Arabic,
that the fruit groves were being bulldozed to punish the farmers for not
informing on the resistance which is very active in this Sunni Muslim
district. Farmers say that 50 families lost their livelihoods.

Thank you! I don't want to put tickets on myself, but I feel I am a
good one. Others have said the same so I guess I have to take

Two out of my three did.
Results show that it didn't make a difference.

Son went to Oz with partner, then broke up and married another Aussi
girl.

Daughter lived with partner two years, got married for another two years
then he got them deep in debt and she came back home, eventually finding
Mr Right.

Daughter courted from age 16 or 17, married him when he qualified as
doctor.     Divorced him when he had affair with nurse!
Lived with second partner for some years, split amicably.
Status now SARAH.     (Single And Rich And Happy).
Well, not very rich, perhaps, but she has her own house....

I only hug female friends and relatives, after two situations arose.
I hugged my 6ft son when he returned home after 12 months in Oz, and he
clearly wasn't comfortable with it.
A lifetime friend contracted Motor Neurone Disease a few years back, and
while he was in hospital for final diagnosis tests I held onto his hand
and squeezed it when shaking hands with him.   He was also clearly
uncomfortable with that, so I don't do hugs with males any more!

I tend to avoid standing too close to people.   I can find it a pleasant
experience for a woman to stand close to me, but I think a conversation
is best held at least at arms length.

Yes!   With men, at least with this one, there is a tiny electric
current sent from the point of contact to my pleasure centre.

When a man touches me, unless a very close friend or relative, the
current goes to a defence control centre.  :-)

Just outside of Witheridge near Rackenford.  In the 1990's we also had a
farm in Witheridge on the Drayford Road - Coombe House, do you know of it?
We had 65 acres of our own but had to rent grass keep from time to time when
our sheep flock grew in numbers.  

I know Barnstaple well.  What was your job there?

Probably not, but I'd find a way to deal with it if I ever visited your neck

Apart from a little salt, nothing!  I'm trying to give up salt too, not easy
but gradually getting used to it.

Eating out in London is horrendously expensive :(  I guess my view on Paris
is tinged with memories of the working times I spent there.  Not a city
lover at all Marion, love open spaces and natural surroundings.  I'm not
keen on Rome or Milan either - too busy, too self-conscious, too stressful.
Now Venice I love!  But if you are staying with your daughter in Paris you
should feel more relaxed that staying in some posh starchy hotel.  As you
may have guessed, I hate hotels LOL

I have found that if add no salt for a short while you find out just how
much occurs naturally in food,  but I do love salt, so I have to
restrain myself.
(You will all have noticed my capacity for self-restraint).  :)

One of two benefits of humidity. The other is that my skin isn't

I prefer to go the the regular salon and get a proper cut and style for
$13 than go to the places which offer pensioner rates...and just cut.<g>

I rarely use salt but do enjoy a bit of it on my chips. Once a month
isn't going to hurt me, especially since my BP is 120/70. I actually
do use a bit of salt in summer to replace lost salts.

=========
I'm like you....I love open spaces and natural surroundings. Having
said that, I do enjoy going to Southbank, but essentially, that's
open spaces and natural surroundings, even though it's just
across the river from the CBD.

Looking across the parklands from one of my favourite restaurants.
The ramp is for the City Cat. The cement along the river is the
cycle/pedestrian track. The long low building is the Art Gallery
and the Entertainment Centre. The higher one is the State Library.
The building in front of the long low building is the State Museum.

Looks very clean and pretty - very much holiday atmosphere.  What is the
mountain in the background - it looks like a mountain but maybe a large
hill?  
Thanks for the links I found them interesting :)

Clammy?
It feels warmer in a humid atmosphere, and that is why 80 in Spain is
comfortable and 80 in England it is sweaty.

I can't place it right now Val. Is it up on Exmoor or more to the
south.  South Molton way. Do you know I'm having the greatest
difficulty trying to remember the names from around there, quite
embarrassing.  Coombe House, the closest I can think of, and I'm not
sure if I've got the spelling right is Coombe Martin, or was that
Combe Martin.  Lynton, Lynmouth, Oare of Lorna Doone fame. Not to
worry, I guess after 40+ years I'm entitled to forget some things.<g>
I was the GPO telecom sales rep. for N.Devon, talk about a big fish in

Arm's length isn't enough, she can hurl an axe further than that.

I did something soppy today, after we'd been for a walk in a wooded area
I bought us fish and chips (No, not that!) and after she got home I rang
her and told her I felt lonely when she had gone. 
She larfed....

Joy wrote to me in response to my reply re makeup: "I have other makeup
but ver very rarely wear it. I have always had extremely dry skin, but
the older I get, the drier it gets. Makup looks splotchy after it's been
on for a few hours. I wear lipstick when the mood strikes me! I do use
moisturizers religiously. Jeanette 
I did try wearing foundation for a while, but I found that the area over
my upper lip always looked as though I hadn't put any makeup on that
spot. It looked weird, so I decided to save the cost and trouble of
using the foundation. "
***********************************
I said previously my skin looked splotchy - weird is a better word!  The
only way I can describe it is to say it looked "fluffy".

Well, they probably went to the master (Sharon) for a bit of guidance
before they did that!  He's full of tricks like that.

==============
The mountain is Mt Cootha....After that there more mountains...
the Brisbane and D'Aguiler ranges. Here's some pictures of
Brisbane from Mt Cootha. My daughter and SIL live 5 minutes
 from Mt Cootha. We often go there for lunch.
http://www.deadmac.com/DeadMacOld/autrip/MtCootha-scenic/html/index.html

You can click on the pictures to enlarge them. You can view all Brisbane and
environs from Mt Cootha as you'll see in the pictures. The flat area the
past Brisbane is the ocean.

I just went and looked in the mirror, then got out the magnifying mirror.
I don't think I look splotchy or fluffy yet....aside from my hands,
which tend to look a bit like spotted wrinkled gloves.<g>

I also pay my utility bills monthly, sit down and write checks for them.
I want to know what the charge is before I paythe bill.  My mobil home
is all electric - a/c & heat, oven and range, fridge, hot water heater,
dryer, washing machine, etc.

My electric bills in the summer when the a/c is on (practically 9 months
out of the year) are under $90 a month; when I use the electric heater,
they go much higher.
Living in the country, using butane or LP gas is the only other
alternative and the gas costs much more than my electric bills.

Paul,
  This is the article to which I referred in an earlier post. I was
reluctant to post it initially because, horrific as it is, I was not
sure of its authenticity. Also I didn't want it to become political
cannon-fodder.   I have since seen, in a Brit ng, that this sorry
episode has been reported on the BBC, which, if their reporting is as
accurate as I remember it, adds the authenticity.
  Obviously this is in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention
on the treatment of non-combatant civilians.  The Convention
specifically states that it is illegal to destroy crops or the means
of lively-hood. The question now is, will the officer responsible for
the decision face a court-martial, or even the international court?
Don't hold your breath.<Ironic Grin>
I feel that this action will stretch American credibility to the limit
unless it is dealt with in the appropriate manner.
  Your comment re Sharon is interesting as I have seen it proposed
elsewhere that the only country to benefit from this attack on Iraq is
Israel.  As there have been rumblings toward Syria, I will not be
surprised if this is the next country on the agenda, in which case,
the US will lose any respect and credibility it happens to have left.
    I don't think for one minute that the UK, even under Tony Blair,
will support yet another foray into another nation.  I recall another
occasion when the British military nearly mutinied against yet another
Labour PM, Harold Wilson. This was when he wanted to send British
forces into Southern Rhodesia to crush Ian Smith and was told in no
uncertain terms that brother would not fight brother, so he backed
down.

Of course, this is what I meant.  Suddenly reality was thrust upon the

First I'm not too sure about this PTS and trauma stuff, I've never had
it and I've had plenty of trauma.  I admit I think of it in term of
yet another pseudo science to keep social workers in employment.
I don't really think the US is out for world domination in the usual
sense.  I think it was a reaction to a violent attack that started the
whole ball rolling.  Remember  that Afghanistan was the first target,
and the US had full co-operation for that adventure.

Once again I don't want to comment on President Bush. I believe he is
following the counsel of his advisors and had to do something. In
Afghanistan I think he was correct, in Iraq, no, he blew it.

I think there's something deeper than oil involved. The US got all the
oil it needed from the ME without going to war. To me, that just does
not make sense.

I don't see Blair withdrawing the troops as yet, it would be an

Hi Jan, interesting post and analysis as always! One comment:  it's
always been my belief that Iraq was attacked a) as an object lesson to
the area or b) to remove a potential threat to Israel, so I agree with
whoever suggested that possibility in another group.

How long ago were you the GPO sales rep for N. Devon Jan?  Our farm was
Coombe House, Witheridge, N. Devon - slap bang between South Molton and
Tiverton on the A361.  Does that ring any bells?

Marmade is tinned seville oranges especially directed at the home marmalade
making department.  Nothing to do with butter or butter substitute 

Clotted cream is very thick fresh buttery type cream - not sweet or sour -
just rich and creamy.  I just love it on top of vanilla ice cream in a cone
- to die for  -  sigh .......!

Actually, that's helpful of you.  I frequently get NO clues from
people.  It is much easier if one dispenses with the games and
says what he/she wants.

But Joy, some men who are a 1 or a 2 also want a perfect 10.  You
would think they'd know better.  I have always found that rather

Okay!  I thought so, but then started thinking there COULD be a
store named Tar-jay.  Hmmm.  Maybe a good name if there is ever a
new upscale Target...

That's probably wise advice.  It's hard enough to get a cut
oneself that one doesn't loathe.

Since then I have only touched on when I have had to iron hems or
a costume for my daughter.  Speaking of that, I have to look for
kimonos and samurai outfits.  I'd better go start a search so I
don't forget.

I'm green with envy.  Hmmm.  Maybe, if it is not hideously
expensive, I could get an electrician to put more outlets in some
of our rooms.

Jeans, t-shirts, and mock turtlenecks don't need ironing!  I don't
like synthetics.  Pants are okay, although I prefer at least a
blend, tops have to be cotton.  I used to have some silk blouses,
but I, er, sweat.

LOL!     On the .net or in real life?
I can do better in Cyber, at least.

My favourite part:

You can FEEL for her, can't you?

I do have a story against myself with my first partner after my wife.
She looked at me in amazement, arms akimbo as I washed a couple of cups
and plates we used at lunch before following her upstairs.

Errm, actually we were walking past the shop and she spotted the shirt
in the window.   She surprised me with a leather jacket one time, and it
bothered me that she had spent so much money.
I hate it when someone buys something I don't like and I have to tell
them.     I don't mean verbally, it's written on my face.  :-(

I'll go along with that.  

However, I think if you will check you will find I start very few threads.
Unless I overlooked one I can find only one thread I started that had anything
to do with politics; "The California Recall and how I would vote".   The rest
concerned jokes.  

I also think you will find that I have not traded many, if any, insults. 
( I suppose that depends on what you call an insult. )

You will find that I respond to political post that I find in error, or insults,
my country or president.

Yes, I've noticed that too.  Also, many men who are a 60 or 70 want a 20

I also pay my utility bills monthly, sit down and write checks for them.
I want to know what the charge is before I paythe bill.  My mobil home
is all electric - a/c & heat, oven and range, fridge, hot water heater,
dryer, washing machine, etc.

My electric bills in the summer when the a/c is on (practically 9 months
out of the year) are under $90 a month; when I use the electric heater,
they go much higher.
Living in the country, using butane or LP gas is the only other
alternative and the gas costs much more than my electric bills.

My gas and electric companies have a "level pay" plan, where they figure
what my cost should be for a year and divide it by 12.  I make monthly
payments of the same amount.  The last month, I pay more or less,
whichever it takes to make it come out even.  I was surprised at
Gordon's figures, because I thought utilities were much higher in the UK
than in the U.S.  My current level pay amount is $34 per month for gas
and &72 for electricity.  OTOH, I do live in California, which could
account for the higher electricity rates.

============
Jan, like you, I waited to post the article until I was able to check its
authenticity. After seeing TV coverage of the devastation as well
as hearing it reported on BBC, I felt that was sufficient.

I agree it is in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention.
Unfortunately, this is just one of the many contraventions of
the Geneva Convention which have been perpetrated by the
Bush regime. Like you, I won't hold my breath about a
court martial, and the Bush administration has declared that
the US will not accept prosecution of US war crimes.

Like you, I feel Syria will be the next country to be
attacked. Bush will keep adding ME nations to his
list of 'axis of evil' states in the hope that the US and
Israel will rule the ME and have control of all ME
oil fields.

Like you, I doubt that Tony Blair will support yet
another foray into a foreign nation. He wouldn't
dare 'sex up' (euphemism for 'lie') more intel
reports again.

And oil and hegemony. BTW, the Bush admin is paying Halliburton

Have you read the NPAC papers and strategies? You
might change your mind about hegemonic agendas if
you do. If you're interested, I can send you some of
the documents.

Exactly. Today was 20 with very low humidity and it seemed
chilly. If the humidity was up, it would seem warm.

Silk blouses are indeed very uncomfortable except in very

========
That sounds quite reasonable as I'm aware that electricity rates are
higher in Calif. One of my epals pays over $250 month for electricity
in the summer. She lives in a mobile home park and must need to
keep her air con most of the time.

I started with only 12, and some of those were singles!
Re-wiring was a must after 41 years, and I was lucky to get it done for
900, including an underground cable to the detached garage.
The electricity authority quoted something over 2000.   

Sadly, he died only months after......

If you do - make 'em all doubles.  My 'man' suggested some in odd
places, like landings and hallway, but they are useful for vacuuming
etc.

Did someone say "What's vacuuming"?    It's something to be done when
the dust is so thick that you catch your head on the ceiling when you
walk across the room.        8-)

All such plans are 'level pay' over here.   A DD which can suddenly take
much more out of your account after a cold spell is unacceptable!
I created spreadsheets to predict my bills by reading the meter at
intervals, but I've almost given up on that, except that I use it to
advise M****, who has a tighter budget, and needs to know in advance.

I can check online how much our telephone bills are before they are due,
but I have the philosophy that bills have to be paid and that's that.

Most of the comparisons you will get focus on the cost of eating out,
gas for your car, and hotel accommodation, which is much higher over
here.   Electronic gadgets and anything like CDs are priced at the rate
of $1 = 1, which is where we really get ripped off.   I prefer to pay
less for essential needs and more for luxuries, that's a fairer society,
in my view.    I won't mention free drug prescriptions, eye tests etc.
:-)

We pay 80% of dental charges, except for those on benefit, pregnant mums
and minors, and because of this we don't get our teeth polished every
time we go    :-)

I don't believe in all that psycho-analysis stuff, I rely on weight
machine cards and fortune cookies.     :-)

I had a lady friend who read Tarot cards, and she did readings for my
daughters and myself after we had been seeing each other for a few
months.    My daughters were quite impressed with what she told them,
and I reluctantly agreed to be 'done'.
When she saw the cards, and looked them up in her little book she
started laughing.     Blushing, she read out "Fun, sex and frivolity".

It didn't need a psychologist to know that much about me - just an
intelligent lady who had got to know me rather well.

She always pointed out that there were different ways of interpreting
the cards to suit different people, that it was all a bit of fun, and
those who charged for 'readings' are charlatans.......

Christine always told me exactly what she wanted, and I always knew it

You girlies are dead sloppy.   I'll confess that I have only one shirt
outstanding which would benefit from an iron on the front edges.  The
other two hanging up in the lounge for three days don't look as though
they need it anyway.   :-)
The rest are in the wardrobe, ready to wear...

There is no such thing as ironing if you don't intend to do it.

Please believe this is just a wise-crack Eugene, not a political point:

I'm glad I discovered such a strategy.  It's easier, and everyone
ends up happier.  Even if *I* think what I want is obvious, it
seems not to be to anyone else.  My other good discovery was gift
cards to books stores.  I love to get them, and I assume any
person I know to be a reader is happy to get one from me too.

I find that odd, although you sure see it.  It does make you thing
the man gets what he deserves (usually)--a gold-digger.  I would
have no interest at all in a very young man.

You may be right.  A story in the past few days, btw, concerns Muslim women
coming to the US, getting Medicare to have their babies and then returning
to their countries.

Not too sure what that's all about, however it does indicate that people CAN
get medical care for free........

Among the very many points I made, the only one that he (mistakenly) tries
to counter concerned as minor aside concerning the marketing of imported
products.  Some shade.

So far, the only comments you've made were inane.

He will surely tire of it one day though, as

At least on the subject of economics no one has been able to refute me.

Eugene,
  I find it rather disconcerting that you would blithely accept the
peace-time suicide rate within the US armed forces and then go on to
say you would be surprised if that rate did not rise in Iraq. 
The numbers on their own offer no information.  What would be
informative would be a break-down of these figures into how many
suicides are regular force and how many are from the reserves.
  If the majority are from the regular force then I would say that
your country has a major problem on its hands. If the majority are
from the reserve force, then there are several possibilities.
Why, in your opinion, would service in Iraq prompt an increase in
suicides?

Regarding the letters. To my mind this is a blatant propaganda stunt,
instigated by the colonel to enhance his own reputation.  Similar to
the pathetic 'rescue' of America's latest 'heroine' Jessica Lynch.  An
episode that has made the US military the laughing-stock of the
civilized world.

I agree.  They can be fun to look at, but for conversation,
companionship, and anything else, give me a mature man any time.
Although the young ones can be handy if you want furniture moved, for
instance.  <G>

That is terrible!  She may have an electric stove, too, which would add
to the cost.  My cooking range is gas.  Where in California does your

I agree it is more fair if necessities are priced lowest and luxuries
higher.  I have to pay all my dental charges, but I can't complain too
much.  I've needed only one filling in the last several years, Medicare
pays about 80% of most of my medical costs, and I have great
prescription drug insurance.

When my late husband and I visited England 18 years ago, I read a
newspaper article about the high energy costs there.  I can't remember
the figure, but the article stated that the annual cost was some huge
amount for every man, woman, and child in England.  It came out to a lot
more than what we were paying.  I'm glad things have leveled out some,
and that energy is more reasonable in England now.

No doubt about it.  In most cases if you do not have the funds medicaid, not
medicare, will pay the bills.  

The process varies a bit from state to state.
http://cms.hhs.gov/medicaid/eligibility/criteria.asp

http://www.cairco.org/econ/econ.html  ( to be taken with a bit of skepticism )
----------------------------------------
In a recent year in Colorado, the state's emergency Medicaid program paid an
estimated $30 million in hospital and physician delivery costs for about 6,000
illegal immigrant mothers - average of $5,000 per baby. Those 6,000 births to
illegal aliens represent 40% of the births paid for by Medicaid in Colorado.
Those 6,000 babies immediately became U.S. citizens and qualified for full
Medicaid services, with a cost yet to be tabulated.
 
An illegal alien mother only has to say she is "undocumented" in order to
receive immediate - and free - medical care. Denver Health is now proposing that
taxpayers approve a bond issue to pay for a bigger obstetrics unit. The present
unit was built for 1,600 births a year, yet last year alone it handled 3,500. 
----------------------------------------------

The real prize of the above is not the care.  It is the fact that the child is a
citizen of the United States of America and that can be a  help in getting legal
residence status in the United States of America for the parents.

I had two interesting offers in today's e-mail.  In fact, they were the
only e-mail I had this morning.

The first is a letter informing me that I am a winner of the Grand
Global Promo Lottery in the Netherlands, and that my share of the
winnings is $550,000.  They don't even ask for a bank account number -
just my mailing address and the name the check should be made out to.
So far, that is.

The second is a letter from the Executive Director of FEDERAL MINISTRY
OF WORKS AND HOUSING (FMWH), country unspecified, offering me a 10% cut
if I'll help launder kick-backs.  They actually use the term kick-backs
in the letter.

On one hand, we have stories of really, really stupid crooks.  OTOH, we
have crooks with imagination, who are looking for really, really stupid
people.

Six in Ten Iraqis Unemployed, but U. S. Subcontractors Hire Cheap Migrant
Laborers

Even though seven million Iraqis are unemployed1, U.S. sub-contractors are
rebuilding the Iraqi infrastructure with cheap migrant labor from South
Asia.2 The use of Asian laborers is at odds with President Bush's emphasis
on the importance of Iraqis taking on the job themselves.

Bush has said the key to "rebuilding a democratic and prosperous Iraq is the
Iraqi people themselves."3 Paul Bremer, the Bush appointee overseeing
post-war Iraq, likewise has talked of the need to turn around the country's
60 percent unemployment rate and "to fix a very sick economy."4

However, the head of the Iraqi Jobless Association, Kasem Hadi, is critical
of the Bush Administration's lack of progress. "Following four rounds of
talks with [Bremer's] representatives, we made no progress regarding the
unemployment crisis,"5 Hadi says.

Meanwhile, U.S. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, one of Bremer's
colleagues, has raised questions about the reliability of foreign workers.
"You find [them] in out-of-the-way corners taking 15 minute naps," she
notes.6

At the same time, officials of the Iraqi Governing Council are concerned
that large American contractors, including Halliburton and Bechtel, may be
inflating the cost of the reconstruction projects. The Iraqi governors told
members of the U.S. Congress that Iraqi companies could be doing the work at
10 percent of the cost.7

I accept what is so.  We live in a world where suicide is a fact.  Nothing I can
do will change that fact nor can I really understand it. 

In war stress and the handling of fear, even the fear of being fearful, becomes
great;  therefore I would expect the suicide rate to go up.  This will happen if
you are a regular or reserve military member.

I also believe a public affaires officer was behind the letter.  The point
being though most of the soldiers did sign the letter and agreed with its
content according to the Gannett News Service.

------------------------
"It's not clear who wrote the letter or organized sending it to soldiers'
hometown papers"

"Sgt. Christopher Shelton, who signed a letter that ran in the Snohomish Herald,
said Friday that his platoon sergeant had distributed the letter and asked
soldiers for the names of their hometown newspapers. Soldiers were asked to sign
the letter if they agreed with it, said Shelton, whose shoulder was wounded
during an ambush earlier this year. 

"Everything it said is dead accurate. We've done a really good job," he said by
phone from Italy, where he was preparing to return to Iraq"
-----------------------

The letter was propaganda designed to get some positive news about the Iraq
struggle back home.  Keep in mind that propaganda is not necessarily lies.
Propaganda,  a noun, is, "information that is spread for the purpose of
promoting some cause". "http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=propaganda

How about leaving creatures off the end of the sentence looks so much

I agree there is nothing to be done about the suicide rate among the
civilian population, I further agree that there is nothing anyone can
do to change that.  However, what is being discussed is suicide within
the military, this is, I think is a vastly different thing.
True there is stress and fear, in fact the person who states he/she is
not afraid is either a liar, a fool, or both.  
Notwithstanding that, the regular soldier/sailor/airman is aware of
this, knows it's going to happen, is, or should be, trained with that
in mind, and lives with it.  So I don't see this as a reason.  As I
stated in a previous post, if this is normal with the regular force,
there is something badly amiss in the selection or training processes.
In the case of the reservist however, the picture changes
dramatically.  Your average reservist I believe, based on experience,
joins for one or more reasons.  They want to earn a bit of spare
money, they want to be in uniform, they want to get a feel for the
military before making it a career, it becomes a hobby or they feel
that they are serving their country by being at least partly trained
in case of a national emergency.  They are prepared to accept the
week-end exercises, and possibly a two week or more training session
in the summer.  What they do not expect is to be yanked from their
civilian occupation and sent a few thousand miles away to be
cannon-fodder.
Once this happens, I can see several areas of grave concern coming
into play.  Can their wives/girl-friends take the separation?  Is
there sufficient money to maintain the life-style they had prior to
being drafted?  If not, how do they maintain their homes and how do
they feed their families?   Add the above to the already acknowledged
fear associated with an active duty posting and you have, in my
opinion, a recipe for disaster.  
However, if the government guarantees that these concerns will be
attended to, then other reasons have to examined.

When operating under the military hierarchy, it is extremely difficult
for the non-commissioned ranks to ignore a 'request' from a senior
officer, especially if they wish to be promoted.  You won't find this
written anywhere, but it is a fact of life.  I would be more
interested in seeing what the troops themselves have to say in their
letters home.  Bearing in mind that they will also down-play any fear
and nastiness as they don't want others to worry.  I've done it
myself.  I think it is the fact that the letter in question was a
form-letter which rather debased the message.  I'm sure the majority
of people think they *are* doing a good thing and take great pride in
what they are doing to help restore peace and prosperity to the area.
It's the method of delivery I find somewhat obnoxious.

 Agreed, it is unfortunate though that the word could not have been
spread to report the same thing in the troops own style in their
letters home.  Perhaps a foot-note to ask parents or wives to pass the
letter on to the local paper, spelling and grammar mistakes included.
This would have made it very believable.

Joan,
This is confession time.  When I first read your introduction below,
"In Marian's absence I guess I'd  better take up the slack. "
my first reaction was "Oh God no, please spare us".<g>
However, on reading the article I was pleased to see that it was not a
self-opiniated  Bush government rant by some media hack, but rather a
well written piece of information complete with sources.  Thank you
for this, but please stay away from the op-ed crap.
What can one add to the article, it is concise and displays the
apparent contempt these companies have for not only the Iraqis but
also for their President and the policies he wants to follow.  Perhaps
it's time for someone high up in government to start reaming out a few
civilian contractors to change things around.  Yet another way of not
winning friends.

#3 quote complete.

Our greatest ally in the vital work of stabilizing and rebuilding a democratic
and prosperous Iraq is the Iraqi people, themselves. Our goal is to turn over
authority to Iraqis as quickly as possible. Coalition authorities are training
Iraqi police forces to help patrol Iraqi cities and villages. Ambassador Bremer
and General Abizaid are working to establish as quickly as possible a new Iraqi
civilian defense force to help protect supply convoys and power plants and
ammunition depots. Offices have been established in major Iraqi cities to
recruit soldiers for a new Iraqi army that will defend the people of Iraq,
instead of terrorizing them.

Dirt work?  Not sure what you mean by that phrase.  Do you mean work that is
too low paid and tedious for most people to want to do it?  From what I have
read there are lots of Iraqis who would be happy to have any paying job.

It is no difference except the stress of overseas deployments and combat.

They should be prepared.  They are told what to expect.  That is what they are
for; to backup the regular military.

How do I know this.  I was in the Air National Guard ( 209th weather Flight )
and the Air Force Reserve (Radio/Navigation) for a total of twenty years (
Including 4 years of regular Air Force).  

The Air National Guard unit was to be deployed to Fort Hood, with the 49th
Armored Division, first and then to Germany if needed.  Most of the two weeks
summer training was spent on exercises using maps of Germany.

For the most part they are. Jobs, employment, are retained by law.  Pay, and
services, in some companies continues at the same rate minus what they get from
the military.  Not ideal but not a disaster.  The reservists get the same pay as
regulars which is not near as bad as it was in the 50's.

-----------------------------

Some truth in that but when the Gannett News Service checked they confirmed the
contents of the letter.  I doubt there was any Senior Non-commisssioned, or
commissioned, officer around when they were interviewed.

Then you should find form letters to congressmen, encouraged by special interest
concerns, equally obnoxious.

One of he things the military does, or at least use to do, is send information
to members home town newspapers for publication.  It was of course always
favorable.  Usually announcing the completion of some training requirement or
promotion.

I see nothing wrong or unusual about the letter.  I certainly do not see the
negative connotations of the letter I feel the posting of it to this group was
supposed to generate.

Yes "dirt work" is hard, backbreaking, tedious, low paid work that many people
will not do.  

However, It is often skilled, dangerous, well paid work that takes special
training to do and many will not do that type either.

As far as, "there are lots of Iraqis who would be happy to have any paying job",
I hear the same story about unemployed workers in the USA.

The operative word here is *should*.  Do you not agree that there is a
vast difference between the regular force and the active reserve, (I
am assuming here that the Air National Guard is active and liable to
be called up as in Iraq, while the Air Force Reserve is passive and
only called up in dire emergency)
After 7 years regular service and another 15 or so in the active
reserve of Britain and Canada I am convinced that while the reservist
is ahead of the game compared to a new rookie, the reservist needs
much more training to bring him/her up to regular force standards.
I always found that the physical level alone needed to  be boosted as
the training periods did not offer enough time to take care of that
side of things.  Two nights a week and the odd week-end just did not
cut it as far as getting people ready for combat duty at short notice.

Thanks for this information, I was not aware of it.  As you state, not
ideal but not as disastrous as I imagined.  There must be more reasons
behind the suicides though, it will be interesting to read the reports
if they are ever released.

They do go through extensive training before being sent into action.  

While I was in the Air National Guard, 209th Weather Flight, we were attached to
the Texas Army nation Guard 49th Armored Division. The Texas Army National Guard
unit would have replaced a regular Army Armored Division, at Ft. Hood, Texas,
that had been sent into action.  After some intensive, full time, training the
Texas Army Guard unit would then have been called forward if needed.  

That was during the cold war and of course missions must have changed greatly
since then.

The National Guard and Reserves are about the same except the National Guard
units are at the beck and call of the Governor of the respective states for
emergencies.  

I also think the National Guard units must be called up as a unit and not as
individuals.  Individuals can volunteer for regular duty  if they wish.

Reservists can be called up as individuals if they happen to possess a skill
that is needed.

Both National Guard and Reservist units have a cadre of full time personnel to
manage the day to day needs of the units.  They are all federal employees and
members of the unit.

I do have to qualify my knowledge on the operation of the units as dated.  It
has been some time since I have served.  Time marched on when I stopped to rest.

Care to be a bit more specific?  What "radical" positions have I taken?  My
position, all along, has been that it isn't necessary to define those with
whom YOU disagree as evil.

Well, when it comes to it, I agree.  OTH, it does reduce their chances at
election.

Besides, it hasn't improved that much, if at all.

Housing starts are UP.  Retail sales are UP.  The market is UP, Waayy UP.
Unemployment is DOWN.  Whaddaya want, egg in your beer??

I think you are correct.  Oil is a vital national resource.  It was/is not
in our interest to let one irresponsible regime gain control of all or most
of it.

Dink, 
 While I do not agree with war I am also opposed to the types of smear
campaigns which seem to be a popular ploy with some US media types.
  I can look at these rantings in the media and shrug.  The man does,
after all, have a private life.  If he thinks Allah is the great
satan, so be it.  Perhaps, in view of his position he could have
exercised a modicum of restraint.  However, the fact that he let his
fervour run away with his mouth should not be held against him.
Surely the fact of whether or not he can do his job is more important
than his religious beliefs.  If he starts issuing US troops with
little, or big red crosses to wear on their chests, I will become
concerned, until that time however why not wait and see if he can
perform the duties assigned to him.
 Would the media be interested in censorship perhaps?  If applied to
General Officers, no matter how stupid they appear, it should also
apply to the media.   Pause for a moment and consider if *your* life
would stand being examined under the media microscope.

God's a Republican?  Marian was wrong all along?  Finally the answer
is revealed.?  Tranquility can now  descend upon the group, all has
been answered, "Praise the whatever".<g>
 God can't "mess" up anything, think about it.   On the other hand
there is this collection of animal life known as humans, but maybe
we're just an experiment.<g>

The minutes in west longitude should be more than 0 and less than 60. Or you
may actually be at W 98.21, in which case, forget it.

No minutes there. Them is decimal degrees.

Ballad of the Blue Berets
Tune:- The Ballad of the Green Berets

History:- Bemoaning the introduction to the Royal Navy 
of the beret with fatigues or "Number eights"

Now listen sailors as from today
With number eights, wear the blue beret
But you'll still need a Pusser's cap
I ask you all, what a feed of crap
CHORUS
Scarlet lanyards on their chests
Steaming bats, and your Oppo's vest
Some are straight, but most are gay
These brave men, wear the blue beret

So off went Jack, with all his pay
Said "give us a badge, and a blue beret"
"Hey what's the game", he cried with pride
"I look just like, a big girl guide!

CHORUS

So off he went, with it on his napper
To various cries of Puff and Snapper!
He doesn't care, its made his day
He's feeling proud, he's a blue beret

CHORUS

Standing parties fallen in
Five three badge men and a piece of skin
He'd better watch his parts today
Those big men wear the blue beret

CHORUS

 
Jan (Inviting you to sing along)

Thanks for answering my questions, Gordon.
(I'm finally back at 60+ after a Real Life interruption.)
Your words "road closures" reminded me of how our son
and 7 year old grandson have done group bike rides
(not races) in NYC. I believe they have special days for these
when they close off certain roads. I was amazed when I
heard my grandson had taken part. Since our son and his
family live almost two hours north of NYC, it was quite a
full day for them. They drove down to the city with their
bikes hitched to the car. I believe the Staten Island Ferry
was part of their itinerary.
I wonder how many cities or towns close off roads on
special days for the enjoyment of bike riders.

Hi Joy,
I know what you mean about getting tunes in one's head.
There are certain ones which stay with you.

Yes, we know dear, Sinclair disappeared about the same time as you did,
so blatant, so obvious........

Presumably he is still too exhausted to write, so you must have been 'de
trop' for him.....
I shall just have to accept the fact that our relationship is over.

Not many, but an excellent example for others.   Some of our towns and
cities have made their shopping precincts pedestrian only now, although
there are car parks adjacent.   It makes for a more relaxed shopping
experience, provided you can avoid the cyclists.    ;-)

What chores are you doing today?
I have so many chores to do that I don't know where
to begin. I can't even set my priorities because I'm
so confused. (lol)
Today my main chore is to "straighten up" and put
things away where they belong. We're still unpacking
from our move and things are piling up around here.
Let me add another question: What chores would you
*like* to accomplish, even if you don't get to them today?<g>

LOL! Oh, Gordon, was it so very obvious? <g>

Gone from my life forever. <g>

Does that mean that the shoppers have to carry their
packages a long way to their cars?
I forgot to mention that parts of the Bronx River Parkway
in downstate NY, used to be closed to traffic for certain
periods on weekends so that bikers could enjoy the
road, which winds through some very pretty scenery.
I never got a chance to take advantage of the program,
but I always wanted to.

Gordon - - Hi!!  Well, yours is faulty reasoning!!!
====1)  your claim that, had Bush not been elected, there would have
been less terror upon our nation.  What on earth brought you to that
conclusion??  The terror campaign against the U.S. had been planned
long, long before Bush was elected.
====2)  the Arab nations are not ignorant - you said.  Oh, but yes, they
are.  they are obsessed in their ignorance.
====3)  you claimed that Israel would become even more belligerent since
they knew Bush would approve ,etc.  Wrong again.  first of all, Israel's
actions are IN RESPONSE only to the Palestinians' suicide bombings - and
you know that - eveyone does.  Secondly, Israel had approval under all
our former Presidents, not just Bush, and yet, when and if they went too
far - in our eyes - they were reprimanded - under all our Presidents.
Gordon - try to have facts rule your bias.

Gordon - -wrong, yet again!  When Saddam invaded Kuwait, that - you
claimed - was under Clinton.  Guess you have problems with your memory.
It was, obviously, under the first President Bush, that we fought
Saddam, in combination with our allies, and drove him out of Kuwait.
Clinton had nothing to do with tht war.====The twin towers attack had
nothing to do with our  present administration, since, obviously, that
attack was planned long, long ago.

Goron - again, a murky memory on your part.  Most of the dreadful events
which have happened (by the terrorists) happened BEFORE Bush took
office. some afterwards.==suicide bombings in Israel, for instance, has
been happening under several previous regimes - but has not stopped yet.
The other points you made are accurate.  Let us resolve  to be accurate

Gordon - - I hope we here, in the U.S. will remember and follow your
sage advice to show "your butts" when a foreign dignitary comes to

usual, refined English mannerism, but sounds more like Gordon's personal
anger.

No real chores today (morning) until I go to work at about 3:30pm.  One of the
two days a week I work.  If you can call sitting on a bus taking care of a dozen
or so visually impaired  kids from San Antonio to Austin work.   More of a fun
trip.

However, the beautiful Rosa will have plenty for me to do when I get back.  The
good thing about that is the priorities will already be decided. :-)

Yes Olly,
I think you are correct - we English (well most of us) are definitely more
refined than that,

Let's be accurate The suicide bombing in Israel were started when
Sharon got aggressive. Israel has ignored the UN violated many UN
Security Council resolutions and been rewarded with guns and money.
The Arabs and Israelis are as bad as each other. Do you know you go to
jail in Israel if you preach Christianity. Rod

You're waaaay behind the times, Olly.  Gordon's post was some time ago,
several people have pointed out that error, and he acknowledged it.
Talk about beating a dead horse!

I have to do some token house-cleaning, because my kids are coming over
tomorrow.  I'm really excited - we're getting together to celebrate my
daughter and SIL's anniversary, but all three of "my" kids are going to
come to the church to see the presentation I'm giving after church.  It
will be a combination of two speeches I've done for Toastmasters -
"Animal Adventures in Australia", complete with photos, and a humorous
speech called "Strine 101".  My son and daughter came to my first Area
contest.  Otherwise, they've never heard me speak in public.  After the
presentation, we're going out to brunch.

Yea ok but no other President has launched pre emptive attacks.
Israel's actions are awful and they are not in responce to anything. 
They have disregarded more UN Securty council resolution than Saddam
Isreal is obsessed in it's own ignorance.  You try to have the facts.
You are the one who is wrong.  The united states attacked Iraq to
protect Israel.  Rod

The general said it.  He smeared himself.  The media just reported it.

He also got it wrong.  Allah is the same god that Christians and
Jewish worship.  His God is Allah by another name.

The general was in his *United States Army uniform* when he said his
remarks.  This was not his private life.  By wearing his uniform, he
was acting as if he was representing the Unites States.

He should be fired at once.  However W. Bush will not do this.  Thus
the decent Muslims and much of the rest of the world will have reason
again to look on the Unites States with contempt at such
hate-mongering be allowed by the President.

And they will be right.

Yes - we have developed a new strain of humans over here with legs.
Usually there are multi-storey car parks very close.

I'm glad you remembered it now.   <g>
There are some disused railway tracks in Derbyshire which have been
converted into walking/cycling routes, but the tunnels have been blocked
off, requiring a couple of detours.    On of them has a long incline, up
which the engines and trains were hauled by a wire rope from a winding
station at the top because the gradient was too steep for a steam train
to climb.    This is a delightful walk in Autumn, when the leaves have
turned to gold and half of them have fallen, an arch of gold overhead
and a carpet of gold beneath, but the timing has to be right or all the
leaves have fallen.

Have you noticed how Olly (aka Lottie) pursues me with all kinds of
accusations?

I suppose I should be flattered by her attentions....

 Please note the following from the report:
"Investigative reporters from the Los Angeles Times and NBC television
have dug up two years' worth of seemingly incendiary comments from Lt
Gen William "Jerry" Boykin, the newly promoted deputy undersecretary
of state of defence for intelligence."

The very use of the words "dug up" indicates to me that these intrepid
'investigative reporters' were looking for anything to smear this
person.  Do you put another interpretation on this phrase?

Not a big deal. Allah, God, Yahweh, Jehovah are all names for the same
something.  Just because he happens to think God is superior to Allah
is not  reason enough to censure him in my opinion.  The muslims seem
to think that Allah is superior.

  I disagree.  If he had made these statements in uniform in a foreign
country, you may have a point.
  However, within the US he is merely another person expressing a
point of view, or are you against free speech for a person in the
military?  The fact that he chose to appear in uniform indicates to me
nothing more than an enlarged ego. Again, nothing for which to be
censured.   Do you really think the 'investigative reporters' would
have not pounced on this even if he was in civvies?

Why?  What has he done that many other people of the Christian
persuasion have not done?   How do you see this as 'hate mongering'?
Has a lack of political correctness suddenly become 'hate mongering'?
The majority of people throughout the world will probably just shrug,
as I do, and write it off to an over-zealous person with an
over-inflated ego.  Bearing in mind what some not so decent muslims
say, he should be applauded, not censured.

True.  I have a feeling she wouldn't like a website I recently learned
about.  I think you might like it, so I'll send you the url by e-mail,
if it isn't munged.  If it is, e-mail me (mine isn't) and I'll send it
to you - if you want it, that is.

My God does not run a virgin whore house for murdering suicide terrorist.
My God says sucide is a sin.
My God says murder is a sin.
My God does not reward terrorist.
My God send all of the above to burn in HELL for all eternity.

I'll have to get Leah to shrink one for me.  I can't find one that
is small enough to send.  I'll also try to get some decent pics of
the new guys.  The one of Frankie is awful--looks like she had her
mouth open and her tongue hanging out....  She is a very nice
looking cat.  She looks very feminine.  (I wonder if I would think
that if I didn't know her gender?)

Good for your God, and I suspect, the good General's God also, 
though I think your God's a bit straight-laced and vicious.
   The first one's a bit of an oxymoron though isn't it?   I mean
really, virgins and whore-houses don't go together do they?  
  Suicide is rather silly, but hardly a sin in my view.
  Murder is to be avoided, however it's then necessary to define
murder.
  I presume you also believe that if you are 'good' all your life
you'll go to heaven, whatever that is.  What is the difference in that
belief and the one that some muslims have that they will be rewarded?
Both are beliefs relating to different religions, who's to say which
one is right.  Certainly not me, I would hope I'm not that
presumptuous.
  Of course, to burn in hell, one has to believe in hell.  If one
believes in hell then one has to believe in satan.  If one believes in
satan then one has to believe that God is not omnipotent.  Bit of a
problem really.<g>
Personally, my God happens to love all things unconditionally, is
non-judgemental, does not lay out a list of dos and don'ts and like a
loving parent doesn't really give a rodents rectum whether or not I
screw up.  My God still loves me, warts and all.  As I am in no
position to determine if I've screwed up anywhere, I'm quite happy
with this arrangement.

Dear Fay,

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding your God.
I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that
knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend
the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that
Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.
I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the
specific laws and how to best follow them.

When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a
pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They
claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?

I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus
21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for
her? 

I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her
period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how
do I tell?  I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around
us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not
Canadians. Can you clarify?

I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill
him myself?

A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an
abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.
I don't agree.  Can you settle this?

Lev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a
defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my
vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you
can help. Thank you again for reminding us that your God is better than
Allah.

I love Flanders and Swan
It isn't just the Irish who had an axe to grind with Oliver Cromwell.

"England's long history of being ruled by monarchs was briefly
interrupted in the 17th century, when Puritan military hero Oliver
Cromwell ruled over a fledgling republic. It was a republic in name
only; and Cromwell ruled briefly as a dictator, called the Lord
Protector, from 1653 until his death in 1658. A few years after his
death, the country had returned to a monarchy under King Charles II.

Cromwell's body was removed from its burial place at Westminster Abbey
and descrated. His head was severed and stuck on a pole, where it stayed
for twenty years -- a potent warning against dissidents. His head was
eventually recovered and reburied in 1960, but nobody knows what happened
to the rest of his body."

>Where did the kids go on their trip?

The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impared, located here in Austin,
sends the kids home each weekend if they wish to go.  We take them down on
Friday  and return them Sunday evening.  I, and usually two others, ride with
them as Weekend Escorts.

Mainly we keep them from fighting, help with rest stop breaks, and other things
that normal kids do.  The entire trip, there and back, takes about 5 hours.

Now I have to confess.  I was still sleeply when I wrote the above and got my
days mixed up.  The trip is Sunday. ( I'll probably forget and be late tomorrow;
today since it is past Midnight and already Sunday)

Verrry interesting.  I wonder if Danny Kaye did a remake, or maybe made
a similar movie.  I'm sure I remember him in that role, or one like it.
I'm surprised I didn't remember it was Bing, because I was a great fan
of his.

You've reminded me that we also have had some
former railway track areas converted to walking/riding
paths. In fact, after our boys grew up, they told us that
they often used that as the path to town, even before
it was converted completely.
We often learn quite a bit about our kids this way now.
It's fun to hear what they used to do without telling us. <g>
As for the new strain of humans with legs over there,
I think you are a new strain too. (lol) But of what, I don't know.
I haven't figured that out yet. (lol)
(No, I did NOT say you are a strain. <g>)

Yes, it's true that things seem easier when we're
focused on the priorities.
When one has too much to do, it gets overwhelming.

Sounds great, Joy.
I have to admire the energy you have for Toastmasters.
I plan to give my Icebreaker speech on Monday and
I'm starting to get a bit tense about it. Sometimes I ask
myself: "Who needs this?" LOL

The movie was made in 1949 and I don think a remake was made of it.
But Danny Kaye did make a film called The Court Jester....
I was a great fan of Danny Kaye..... and I think I saw all his
movies...

I'm betting you'll do a good job and be totally exhilarated by the
experience - especially after you get some nice comments from other
members.  As my son used to tell me (and his Dad when he was competing
in a quartet contest), "break a tonsil".  <G>

I'll bet that's the movie I'm thinking of.  Yes, I loved Danny Kaye too.
Mostly I liked Bing's singing, although I enjoyed his movies too, but
there was something about Danny Kaye's personality that was special.

Thanks, Joy.
I have to remember to relax my throat or
I *will* break a tonsil. <g>
Actually, I think the Icebreaker must be the easiest speech
because it's so easy to talk about ourselves. No need to
memorize very much.
Probably the speech which needs the most rehearsing is
a joke, because a joke, if it isn't worded just so, can fall
flat. I understand that even some numbers are funnier
than others. For example, I think that "thirty-three" is funnier
than "eighteen". <g> More rhythm for one thing.
And the punch line must be worded correctly and
delivered well. Timing is everything in comedy.
I'd rather talk about myself than tell a joke. (lol)

I had heard that Rod....about going to jail if you preach Christianity.
In re suicide bombings, I agree with you. The Israeli's have modern
guns which they have purchased with US money. The Palestinians
don't have that so they use the only weapon they have...a suicide
bomb.

Just like our presence in Iraq?  Which the President promised would
not be long?  When the President promised we would not be involved in
nation-building?

Sadly, you are right, this will pass.  Under Bush's war against Muslin
fanatics, Christian fanatics are perfectly okay to him and many US
citizens.

So pitiful.

***************************************
Has anyone seen the new "The Office"!  It's pretty funny - that tall
skinny looking blond haired guy with huge circles under his eyes, who is
filled with his own self-importance, the stooge for David Brent.  In the
first episode, he gets on his phone and starts saying "Oggy Oggy Oggy
and oink oink oink."  Wonder if that is what he referring to, but no
that would make sense, nd Gareth is such an idiot, eve more so than his
boss.  Also the staff from thebranch which was closed in Swindon, come
to the office; David is still in charge but has anew boss.  David starts
his usual nonsense of strange noises and weird dances and nasty jokes;
the newcomers report to David's boss that they are offended by his
racist jokes.  He is such a fool, he's funny.  Tonight will be the 2nd
of 6 episodes, I believe.  It's an example of slapstick comedy, in my
opinion.  Jeanette

Hi Jeanette,
I learned a long time ago never to put my primary
email addy out on a newsgroup.
As you can see, I use a Yahoo addy instead.
My Yahoo addy gets quite a bit of spam, but at
least Yahoo dumps it all into a Bulk Folder for me
and I can delete all of it with one click.
It just takes constant monitoring if you don't wan't
the Yahoo mailbox to fill up to max and reject
incoming personal e-mail.
Does Hotmail put all your spam into a Bulk Folder
for you? I find that it's a tremendous help.

Yes.  The very fact that Israel was taking over other countries
territory  inflamed the Arab world;  Sharon is not a nice man.  It's as

Feel free to do so.  I just pointed out that your references, allowing many
things that would be frowned on now, were from the Old Testament.

I am not an expert on the New Testament but I do not think any of the quotes you
gave from Leviticus or Exodus are encourged in the New Testament.

possible solutions?

In this day and age, with the price of beef so high, may I suggest the
following adjustments while keeping the main principle.   
Substitute t-bone steak for bull and barbecue for altar.  The odour
will remain pleasing to the Lord, a burnt offering will be available
and you could always invite your neighbour over for supper. 
 This, I feel, will resolve three dilemmas, 1) The Lord, your God will
be appeased with the odour from the burnt offering,  2) you will be
fed and 3) your neighbour, instead of complaining,  may even
contribute some wine to the festivities thereby permitting you to love
thy neighbour as thyself.

If your daughter is anything like some of the foul-mouthed little
brats I see fairly frequently, I would suggest taking any amount
offered.  Any price would be a fair price to get rid of them.

Simple, be alert for mood-changes and head-aches.  Alternatively watch
their actions.  Should they sneak through a friends house and shoot
out of the room on a skate-board, be suspicious, should they start
jumping cracks in the side-walk, again approach with caution.  The Ark
of the TV may also provide further clues.

Mexico is fine, purchase as many as your budget can handle, as the
saying goes, "A slave a day keeps boredom away". 
 Stay clear of Canada.  Canadians have this aversion to being slaves
to anyone but their current government.  When placed in captivity they
tend to be a surly and rebellious lot who may even burn down white
houses.<g>  Best to leave them alone with their ice-hockey and

Of course you are.  This is not murder, this is justifiable homicide.
The Lord be praised.  However, a word of caution should be injected
here.  Make sure you have sufficient groceries and other necessities
like gas to get you through the Sabbath.

As long as the only day of the of the week on which shellfish is eaten
is a friday,  the abomination level is reduced.  I do not recommend
eating homosexuals on any day.

To understand the reason for this, one has to study the opticilus
connundrous.  Many of the faithful, unfortunately with reduced visual
ability were approaching the altar and actually tripping over it.
This caused many blasphemies to be uttered in the area of the holy of
holies. Not to mention the confusion caused when the priest was
knocked over, the wine spilled and the clothes rent as the unfortunate
worshiper stumbled around.  Thus the edict was brought into effect. 
 I feel however, that with the corrected vision brought about by the
wearing of the glasses, you no longer have a defect in your sight and
will thus be able to approach the altar of God without causing mayhem.

Did he define 'long'.  When compared to eternity, how long is long?
One has to be very careful when understanding politicians, they speak
with forked tongues.

Now you see you have to define 'nation-building'. Is it restoring a
nation that has been destroyed or is it expanding ones own empire?

May one enquire what *your* reaction would be if your neighbour, in
this case Palestine had vowed to bull-doze you and yours into the sea?
Do you consider Arafat a 'nice' man?

How come Israel is allowed to have the bomb and there is no
inspection? How come we are mad at Iran for having the potential to
have the bomb? How come the US and the UN say stop putting up a fence
and Israel keeps doing it? A few days ago there was talk on this group
about UN SC resolutions I looked them up on google and stoped at 12
violated by Israel Security Council Resolutions there were a lot more
and 38 vetoed by the US why don't we bomb Israel. They look like real
bad guys. The UN Security Council disapproves but a lot of American
Presedents say OK does that make it OK? Rod

*******************************************
Hey Gordon:  I couldn't find "bloviating" in my Merriam-Webster
dictionary.  I assume codswallop means something like "horse-hockey"
(and not the kind of hockey whereby one rides on the back of a horse
trying to hit a little ball); was able to find onomatopoeic which means
the naming of a thing or action by a vocal imitation of the sound
associated with it; the use of words whose sound suggest the sense,
i.e., buzz, hiss. - 
I suppose one could count the sound  for giving a raspberry!  Jeanette

=========
The 'short' war has now been extended to at least 2006.
IMO, nation-building is expanding one's own empire.
Xian fanatics don't need to turn themselves into mobile
bombs....they have military hardware.

Although he presented wonderfully in comedy....there were moments when
he looked out of the screen and seemed to look right into your eyes...
His serious moments were quite beautiful....Remember Hans Christian
Anderson ..... and...

Exactly. And unfortunately, Bush is encouraging that very unnice man.
Therefore, Sharon feels he has US backing and continues his own
nation building. I expect another Israeli missile attack shortly, in an
attempt to further inflame ME tensions.

Lying (or should that be laying?) in my hospital bed last Friday
(false alarm for chest pains) the nurse offered me the TV controls and
said 'Enjoy!'  I had the choice of Rugby, Football, Cricket, Motor
Bikes or the Children's Programme......I chose radio  <grin>

Errm, I THINK I understood that last sentence <g>, and saw it in my
mailbox, but I've been out walking today, then out to M's for a pizza,
just came in here to knock off a few posts, and will have a look
tomorrow evening I expect.

I hope it's nothing disrespectful to you-know-who!  <g>

Indeed!  It exposes just how out of date and ridiculous the bible
'teachings' are.   If the Anglican church doesn't come into the 21st
century and stop treating homosexuality as a curable disease, the
churches will be completely empty before very long...

I saw my security light come on in the back garden this evening, and
when I looked out to see the trespasser, I was delighted to see for the
first time the fox that all my neighbours appear to have seen in my
garden.  He/she sniffed around under the bird feeders and then quickly
went over the fence into next door.
I may try leaving a little treat for him, he looked thin....

I use Mailwasher to filter and delete mail on the server, but the amount
of junk mail is escalating again, though only a few are 'Microsoft'
virus emails.    I received, or rather deleted, in excess of 250 junk
emails today.   :-(

My demon mailbox never 'fills up' to the extent that it rejects mail.
I read and 'file' genuine emails, and have some from more than two years
ago!

I hope they didn't stick a nitroglycerin patch on you as they did on me
when the same thing happened a year or so ago.  That was a killer
headache!  As I recall, I had a choice of soaps, lurid talk shows, or
turning the thing off and reading.  Luckily, I had brought a book with
me.

Yes, he had a very special quality about him.  I don't think there's
anybody of his calibre performing now.

I enjoy the political dialogue, except when people seem distressed by
the differences of opinion.  There are long threads where I've lost
interest that I just don't open.  Why not do that if you are off a set
of topics fo awhile?  Toci

Actually, I wish I hadn't decided to give my Icebreaker
speech this week. There's just too much going on.
Our son is coming down from Montreal and will stop by
our new house for the first time... and guess where I'll
be... at Toastmasters. But I'm not the type to cancel out
on something like this. I'm hoping our son will be late,
as usual, and I'll be home by the time he gets here.
A little to the left, Gordon. <g> Ah!

Was the fox red or gray?
I almost hit a deer tonight while driving. He ran
across the street just a few yards ahead of me.
I guess I was lucky.

i used to have kangaroos feeding in my yard at the old place the
winter before last. we had very dry weather and some of the only
edible grass for km's was in our backyard. i used to waste a bit of
water even, just so they had a nibble.
was a bit of a surprise though when you'd go out in the middle of the
night for a piddle and skippy would come bounding past you.

It is rather sad that in some areas the kangaroo has required
culling........my young grandson met his first wallabys last Christmas
and there is a delightful photograph of him trying to lift its
tail.... he said it looked heavy and was trying to help....

I am happy to say that angina is not one of the things I suffer
from....but you know what it is like.  Chest pains and naturally they
take every precaution.   
I have to to admit....our local hospital is becoming a home away from
home lately....three trips in less than a year.  But I've got to admit
that it is nice when you are recognised with a smile and a cheery
greeting.

they'll always be nice but at xmas there's nobody qualified to do
anything still working in the place.
i had a turn at xmas 1999 and they wouldn't release me till a
specialist had seen me. but since that was still 4 weeks into the
future they let me out after only 4 days. of course all the printouts
and buzzing from the wires they had hanging off me were totally wasted
as there was nobody around who could read what they meant.

Ok! Ok!  You don't have to sing 'Advance Australia Fair'  a couple of
Oi!s will do....<grin>  A happy belated birthday greeting to you
Bazza... wish I was as young as you are.....
Happy Anniversary to the old Opera House too....30 years it has been
standing there,  and hosted some very famous people.....(popped in
there myself actually....)
Well now.....I have been absent a bit of the time,  had a long weekend
visitor so only had time to download my mail, while she took a
shower.... When she left I took a big breath and began to answer my
mail....but the breath must have been a bit too big  'cos I landed up
in hospital with a monitor on my chest.   A false alarm though....but
gee we have some very handsome male nurses in Ballarat....I think they
may be what keeps me going back there....
All the medicos here are so young....hardly a gray hair among them....
a bit of a change from those pompous types in Melbourne....<grin>
Glad to see you back anyway.....throw in a post now and again will
you.....just to help keep this end of the world in touch....

Only an overnight stay Val....a precautionary measure only....it
turned out to be the arthritis in the neck causing the problem....but
as the ambulance man (who looked exactly like Nicholas Cage I am glad
to say) said....we can't ignore the remotest possibility....
So I hitched up mi nighty and climbed onto the trolley......and away
we went...
The only bed they had available was in the orthopaedic ward so there I
am sitting up in bed eating breakfast,  while the three elderly ladies
looked enviously on.....it seems they were only allowed fruit juice.
Almost choked on my toast and jam I did......

It sure does not seem that way in America nowadays.

Check out this link for an example from yesterday's Sunday newspapers:


  http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.html?uc_full_date=20031019


For those who don't check this link, let me quote in part:

"The following is a public service message to an incredible 69% of
Americans. THERE IS *NO* EVIDENCE OF A LINK BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN AND
9/11! *NONE!*  EVEN THE *WHITE HOUSE* ADMITS IT!"

People seem to have far less sense than I credited them for.

True.  Nowadays Christians leaders rape little boys or kill them
during prayer groups.

Do you know about the Crusades?  The Inquistion?  The Salem Witch
Trials?

Or are you Jewish?

They do go around killing doctors, however, as well as blowing up
medical buildings and places where gay people gather.

There was the bombing at the Atlanta Olympics that killed an innocent

Close enough for me.

It seems the Christian fanatics don't blow themself up because they
want to stay alive to be able to hurt and kill more people.

They say that a period of cold, wet and windy weather is going to sweep
across Britain from the East.  Tomorrow night is set to be the coldest.

Not as lucky as the deer was!  All foxes are grey in the dark, or in the
beam of a sagging floodlight.  The man is coming to fix it on Friday.

You wouldn't have to think about it they had left the Bible alone,
Gordon. By making a non sexist "CREATURES" out of the original
"BROTHERS"  they freak out folks who step on an ant. And before you
know it we'll all be Vegans.   :-)

Thank God for that. That should take care of all the hot air that's

Did they really do that?     How can you be a Vegan when you're on an
Atkins diet though?

My mother has had heart trouble for decades, and has nitroglycerine
tablets handy.  However, she almost never takes one, even when she is
having severe chest pain.  I couldn't understand that, and her
explanation, "The nitro gives me a headache" didn't make sense to me.
Then I had that patch and found out what she meant.  I've had some bad
headaches, but nothing to match that.  I had forgotten about my mother's
comments until I mentioned the headache to a nurse and she said, "Oh,
yes.  That's the nitro."  Now I understand my mother - and you (at least
when it comes to nitro).  My pain turned out to be esophageal spasms.
The doctor told me nitro helps with that too.  I guess you have to
decide which pain is worse.  Luckily my doctor found something else to
help with the spasms, which I don't have very often.

It's a wonder anybody ever takes nitro voluntarily - more than once,
anyway.

I'm sorry you had the problem, and the hospital stay, but I'm glad the
nitro helped without giving you the headache.

How's the clean-up going Paul?  I spoke to Pete just before the
week-end and he told me the weather was wet and windy.  I believe he
has done some dives and was getting ready for this week which was to
be the start of the busy period.

about 250 years.

Which one?  There were three operating in Spain, France and Italy. I

As these are all somewhat ancient history is it alright if I start a
thread about the invasions of Britain by the Romans, Norse first then
Norse again?  Totally unprovoked attacks which should be condemned.

Why do you have doubts about my well-being, jingles? Just because I

somehow I don't feel retired with all the stuff that's going on in my

Since I'm Secret Santa coordinator for a newsgroup,
I receive quite a bit of mail at my Yahoo addy.
So I'm thankful that I can clear out the junk mail with
one click.

Yes, the deer was very lucky. <g>
They wanted to re-introduce Moose to the Adirondacks,
but that would have been terrible for the drivers.
Hitting a moose is much worse than hitting a deer.
Drivers have been killed that way.
Maine has a pretty good moose population.
Remember the moose in Northern Exposure,
the TV series? It seemed as if  he had his own
music in the intro. <g>

Are you going to scrub the floors? <g>
I knew a gal who had to wear rubber gloves just
to wash the dishes because her skin was so

I am a Christian. Jesus said I have come to fulfil the testament not
to destroy it. He must blush and hide at what we do in His name.. The
ten commandants say thou shalt not kill. I am puking   at what is
being done in the name of the Lord. Rod

I am a Christian. Jesus said I have come to fulfil the testament not

ten commandants say thou shalt not kill. When we kill not because we
are threatened but because somebody might do something we turn away
from the teachings of the Christians with pre-emptive war.People who
do that are foul criminals  No amount of fancy words or stupid logic
will stop me from puking. I am puking   at what is being done in the

i think in QLD everyone gets a free ride now, since they put a levy on
the power bills in July.
i got my 2 yearly good news letter yesterday with my disability
pension being extended for another 2 years after the nuisance and
stressful review. i wish they'd just leave me alone like they did 30
years ago.

am I reading this correctly?  You have to go through the whole

Rumsfeld not Bush but then it is Bush's man said on April 13, 2003
Meet the Press: "The task is to create an environment that is
sufficiently permissive that the Iraqi people can fashion a new
government. And what they will do is come together in one way or
another and select an interim authority of some kind. Then that group
will propose a constitution and a more permanent authority of some
kind. And over some period of months, the Iraqis will have their
government selected by Iraqi people." On the same program, Ahmed
Chalabi, the Pentagon's favored exile, stated: "After (Gen. Jay
Garner) finishes his job of restoring basic services, the interim
Iraqi authority will be established. And that interim authority will
be an authority of Iraqis, chosen by Iraqis. And it will be able to
function as an authority in the country immediately after Gen.
Garner's job is finished, which should be only a few weeks."

When did you last wash the dishes? <g> I expect you have a dishwasher.

Fact 1 - Modern washing up detergents are not kind to your skin, in fact
they remove all the natural oils if you are not careful.

Fact 2 - To hand-wash dishes in hot enough water to be effective, you
would scald your hands, unless you wear gloves.  

This is why I wear rubber gloves to wash up, but of course I do this
after almost every meal.....

Fact 3 - These hands, which have given so much pleasure to a few special
women, are not to be roughened by menial tasks......

Well, autumn is really here now in northern England, the temperature was
down to -4C last night in my garden, and today the sky clouded over and
we had some rain.   But it has brought the Greenfinches, Goldfinches and
Great tits back to my garden feeders.

Ah, time heals all wounds.  I bet that was a lot of comfort to those
innocents centuries ago who were tortured and hanged and burned alive.

Islam is a realitive young religion, especially compared to
Chrsitianity.  Christianity at the same age as Islam is currently was
widely doing the same horrible things that Islam extremists are now
doing.  0nly in Christianity case, it was official church policy.

Christians need to realize this.  They need to remember their religion
was once as guilt of many of the same evil things some Muslims are
doing today who believe in Islam.  This is not for the Christians to
condone it, but rather that they need to remember their hands were
once has equally bloody, if not more so.

It's too late for me now because I can't easily change my demon address,
and I didn't munge it from the start for newsgroups.  One day I may get
it changed though.

Mailwasher automatically filters 98% of the spam now I've got it set up,
so it's a one-click operation.  I just save the V*agra ones in case....

I'm glad to hear it, Jeanette.  I didn't know it was ever used for BP.
The medication I take for that has no side effects - or rather I am
experiencing no side effects from it.  ;-)

Yes I did, and I agree - all around.  Of course maybe if he'd look for
somebody in his own age group, he'd have better luck with marriage.  Did
you see him in "City of Angels?"

That depends on what you've been eating.  If you're trying to catch a

Bate is a form of "abate".  I believe "bated breath" means you're
holding your breath.

That's appropriate, since getting unpleasant or insulting about politics

Different moose and different show, but I liked Bullwinkle and Rocky.

Northern Exposure was about a fictional Alaska town.  My mother, who
lives in Alaska, said a lot of Alaskans enjoyed watching the show
because it was so ridiculous.

Incidentally, Sea is right about hitting a moose being dangerous.  A
friend of my mother's had an accident with a moose before my mother
moved to Alaska.  The woman hit the moose, apparently while driving
fairly fast.  The moose landed on the top of her car, and the woman had
brain damage as a result.  She walks with a limp and has trouble with
speech, among other problems, as a result.

Jeanette - - there is a difference between imposing (sometimes in an
insulting manner) one's views upon others, or discussing various points
of view.Many are, indeed, interested in politics and world affairs, and
they should, ideally lead to good discussions.  If only people will
remain civil.  I noticed that,currently, there was a dicssion about
religion - -well, nothing could possibly be more delicate and
controversial than that!!  Why don't you let those who do feel insulted
plead their own case, and solve their dilemma, and let the chips fall
where they may!!!!!!
I, for one, much prefer exchanges about world affairs, politics, yes,
religion , if need be, cultural questions,etc.etc. - than what chores we
are planning to do, or how we spent the day yesterday,etc.etc.
Although, occasionally, I, too, enjoy some little reverie, either from
the past, or from personal experience - as long as that does not become
a "chronic" condition!!
An e-mail, private partner and I once almost came to blows (!!) over the
question: who is the better tenor: Luciano Pavarotti or Placido
Domingo!!  My choice was Pavarotti - - I am throwing this out as a
challenge!!!!!!!!Olly

That speech, which Bush made, about "you are either with us or against

wrote.  It was excellent; a statement of resolve against terrorism, in
the hope of soliciting others to act also to root out the terrorists.

Joan - not mine.  You suggested that insurance companies already
supervise who gets what health  reimbursements, and treatments.  Yes,
the HMO's do, you are correct.  I do not have an HMO; I have Medicare,
and, what ever is rejected by Medicare, is picked up by my supplemenal
Medex (BCBS) insurance.
Thus, literally everything is covered, and I have free choices.
However, it is dreadfully expensive, and therefore, is not the solution
for the many who could not afford it.  I can just about barely afford
it.It is shameful not to have a workable system for everyone.====Olly

We went out for a meal with friends this evening, a very pleasant
conversation, plenty of laughs.
It started very cold today, and wet, but as the low cloud crept across
the sky the temperature eased upwards......

bob - I read the story in the paper about these Muslim women coming here
to have their babies, and then return.  It raises my hackles - yes, they
DO get free care.  And free (emergency) care is available to all poor
people - but it is limited and uneven.  The system desperately needs
some changes.  I have never been able to find a copy or description of
the system which Hillary Clinton had been trying to set up at the time.
Regardless of how one feels about Hillary (ugh!!)  but I heard it was a
very comprehensive, all-inclusive (and probably prohibitively expensive)
plan, but most felt it was unwieldy and not workable.  But I never heard
any details.

I didn't read this post properly.  Do you get a stiff neck and when you
move your head a certain way feel as though you are going to 'black out'
I wonder?

No?  Oh well I'm unique then!
I have to keep my neck muffled up against cold winds or it seizes, with
unpleasant results.   Hence the neck warmer filled with herbs and
wheat....

Fair enough, but I just gave up on bouncing and now just delete them,
although the numbers have increased since I did that.

I switched to bouncing again today as an experiment, but I get an awful
lot of them undeliverable because "the addressee does not have a Yahoo
account".  Probably because it was a spammer who set up an account,
spewed out the rubbish, then abandoned it or was kicked off.   :-( 

ISPs like Yahoo and Hotmail have a lot to answer for.....

I had to scrape the ice off my windscreen this morning, before I 
set off for work.....first time this year!

But hasn't it been a marvellous summer!

I know a woman who wears what looks like a neck brace because of a
similar problem.  Actually, she has several, in different colors, so she
can coordinate them with what she is wearing.

So would I!  Luckily I finally bit the bullet and had air conditioning

Dear Olly, Pavarotti has perfect pitch and is a pleasure to
listen to, especially in belle canto roles such as those written
by Donizetti, his top Cs are so pure. Domingo on the other
hand started his adult life as a baritone and was encouraged
to sing tenor parts, so now his voice is more suited to the heavier operatic
roles of Verdi and Wagner although both men are equally excellent in Puccini
parts. Pavarotti does a lot of recital work whereas Domingo sings more
operatic work and is also an excellent actor, Pavarotti is very wooden in
his operatic roles. Both men are divine to listen to but Domingo
has the bonus advantage of being a pleasure to watch also.
Placido gets my vote. Enough dialogue, lets all sing.

I have arthritis in the neck and the discs have worn away....the one
in the shoulder girdle causes the most problems....but I never tilt my
head backwards or I would black out....<grin>
Neurologist says they won't operate unless I am paralysed or writing
in agony, because it is too dangerous.....Ain't life grand? 

Got a joke for you Gordon....heard it on TV this morning.

Annie an 80 year old lady in a nursing home woke up feeling very
randy.....she wandered out into the corridor and found William a
sprightly 85 year old  coming out of his room.  She put the hard word
on him and they both went back inside....
They began to make love and suddenly she said "I have acute angina"
"Mmm! " said William "your breasts are pretty good too...."

Boom! Boom!

A coolish 12C in Ballarat today,  but the sun is brilliant and the
sky as blue as it is possible to be.   It rained all day yesterday so
the flowers are dew drenched and gorgeous.....and the birds are
twittering away on my front veranhad as they toss the seed out of the
feeder all over the concrete.... The resident honey eater is busily
ruffling the branches of the teatree and the blackbird with the broken
tail is getting ready to hassle the sparrows.   God's in his heaven
and all's right with my world....

Each to his own as the old lady said when she kissed the cow....

I for one prefer the lighter posts of the newsgroup.  World politics
do interest me....but not the arguments that go with the topic.
What I do hate to see is people who like the lighter side of this
newsgroup leaving because they feel overwhelmed by   the heavier
topics.  I believe it behoves us to try and maintain a balance.
As for your choice of tenor,  I agree that Pavarotti is excellent,
Domingo happens to be just a trifle better <grin> but if you don't
break my Domingo CDs,  I will return the courtesy and leave your
Pavarotti CDs intact.

jingles - who is now going to take a coffee break, and maybe throw her
husband on the floor and tear off his clothes....( note I said
maybe...)  or perhaps I should settle for a cream biscuit....

When you say 'black out' does everything start to wobble
so that you feel that you are going to fall over? I have a
cervical spondylosis and a side effect of that is vertebro-basilar
insufficiency. It's caused when the arteries to the base of the brain are
obstructed and the flow of blood is impeded. Unfortunately there is not a
damn thing that can be done about it except the old adage of 'learning to
live with it'. You'll just need to be careful not to jerk your head around
quickly.

I make different coloured covers to slip over my brace to
match outfits. They blend in so well that in the warm weather
when the brace is obvious I am asked what have I done to my neck? I was
prescibed my first one in 1976! My disguise
must work. <g>

Jan--I agree with everything you posted about Pavarotti and Domingo.
Only my favorite - by far - is Pavarotti.  There is a certain amazing
quality to his voice, and, it seems to me that Domingo, though having a
lovely voice, but when he hits the high notes, they seem to sound tinny,
and often nasal.  Anyway - I have a CD player right on my headboard. At
night, I slip in one of Pavarotti's - and listen - and think I am in
heaven.  I also have some where he sings with Joan Sutherland - who,by
the way , is my favorite female soprano.  Life could not be better, when
listening to that kind of music!!!  Invariably I all asleep!!!

Jingles - - while you are on the floor with your husband, I am trashing
your Domingo CD's .  Watch out!!
On a different note - to respond to your comments - I, too, enjoy the
give and take of some lighthearted exchanges, but not as a permanent
peoccupation.  I enjoy discussions about interesting topics, be that
politics, art, social issues, and all he many things which have always
been of interest.
Yet - it seems to be difficult to have a serious but civilized exchange
of different views, wihout the rancor that usually develops, especially
in politics.  Yet, the world is so interesting - and dangerous - these
days - and always has been - that it seems hard to escape voicing one's
concerns and views, and hoping for a discussion without too much bias.
Well, I shall try to "stifle".  God knows what that will do to my
psyche!!!

It would have been about that time , or a bit earlier,that a
specialist prescribed one  for me.   I wore it for a year and then
went to a very knowledgeable physio who worked in a hospital.  I was
there for two weeks and underwent treatment twice a day....very
painful at times I must add.
But I came out without the brace and with a bit of help from the
physio  kept reasonably well until the last couple of years or so.
The makeshift brace was suggested to me by a physio to use when a
particular activity caused pain.   For the most part it works quite
well.

I find that where such serious topics are concerned 'face to face'
discussions are better.  There is not the same temptation to 'blow up'
as there is on a newsgroup -  there is not the same anonymity to hide
behind...
Even face to face I have seen a 'discussion' of America's attack on
Iraq fragment my family.....two of my children are no longer speaking
to each other after having a 'serious' discussion which almost came to
blows....  My daughter is married to an American,  my son is
Australian.   A second son walked out on the argument and told them
both to 'drop dead'.....

So you see,  I will romp with you,  joke with you....and pull your
leg.....but I will not argue politics with you....

jingles - who now has to carry the can.

Those two did some marvelous recordings together. I said
to Mike a while back that one of my favourite recordings
was of Pavarotti, King of the High Cs. Knocks your socks
off. It's one of Mike's also.

I was told to wear it all the time when I first got it and only take it off
when sitting still. I even had one for night wear.
Then I got to thinking that my muscles would go slack through
lack of use  so I only wear it on transport because travelling
over bumps and hard braking is painful. I still do my neck
exercises to keep the muscle tone and I do have a special neck
roll for night. Sometimes I have to resort to my night collar.
I have two & half discs missing so the vertebra are fused,
I have the same prob with my lower back and a steel corset,
but that's another story. :-)

Mindless remarks are nice but not in the context of real discussion.
O.W. Homes once said  "I find the great thing in this world is not so
much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the
port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes
against it, but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor."  You
can get all mindless blather you   want from a telly. Rod

I don't know if you had the same advert for Wall's Corneto
Ice-Cream but the words were 'Just one Corneto, Give it
to me, Delicious ice-cream, From Italy' sung to O Sol Mio.
So well known that when in Italy and a busker was playing
that tune the whole group of us broke out into 'Just one
Corneto'. Do you have Wall's.

I regret we don't have Walls....but I remember a piece of classical

And a Merry Christmas to you too Rod.....<grin>

One of the mindless blatherers.....

It occurs to me that some of us like to participate in the mindless
blather rather than have it spoon fed to us via the idiot box....
But as I so frequently say.....whatever turns you on....<grin>
There is room for us all on the big wide beautiful web......the nice
part is that we can always move on if we don't like the
location.......

supposed to be that hot here in October!

There are certain issues which can split groups, because where there are
polarised views, people tend to accuse the holders of opposing views as
'biased'!      They assume that if they can convince the other side that
they are 'biased' they will change their views.
This will never happen.

If people wish to debate issues seriously, they should join a debating
society composed of people with differing points of view.
When the speakers have finished, the whole assembly vote according to
which was the most convincing argument.
Then they all shut up and go home.   ;-)

In this country (UK) we joined in a war without any such debate other
than in Parliament, where the Opposition supported the government
anyway.   If there had been a referendum of all citizens, we would not
have had a war.

This is the source of much of the conflict for and against war in the
groups, and I am heartily sick of it.

I am convinced, as is most of Europe, that the better way would have
been to carry out thorough inspections in Iraq, backed by a *United* UN,
not one split by unilateral agendas of a small minority.

There, I have gone and done it again.

A clear statement of my opinion, no rancour, no bias.
Let no one accuse me of either!

It gripes me hearing about all these 'sprightly 85 year olds'.
I'm 70 soon and my sprightliness is hanging by a thread...

It wasn't an option for me either, mother nature did it
all by herself. I was offered an op: but it was only a 30% chance of sucess
or it might even make it worse. I'm not
so much green as cabbage looking, operating in the neck
 area, surgeon sneezes, paralysed from neck down, I don't
think so, I'll put up with the pain, I still enjoy my walks.<g>

Mine is a problem with fixed sacroiliac joints, the lower
back bones that are suppose to slide when bending. I have
learnt to bend from the hip instead of the waist,(waist? what waist?)
It is a bit easier but then of course there is, like many of us,
the arthritis in left side of hip, knee,shoulder and two thirds of
the spine. The bad news I was told, was I had arthritis, diagnosed when I
was 23, the good news was it was osteo-!
Old age doesn't come itself. <bg>

Joy was correct.   Bated or 'bated means holding your breath.

Baited was what I did with that Plan B post.  I hooked one or two,
others joined in, and some just swam by without noticing....

Remember - you heard it first from me, and it could out-live the Atkins

M wife liked the Three Tenors, with a slight weakness for the Spaniard,
but that was purely hormonal.  :-)

M**** loves Bocelli, and I must admit he has a very plaintive quality in
his voice in some of his songs.  

Unfortunately his name sounds like a bacterial culture.

Sounds familiar.   Nobody has told me I have a spondylosis, but I have
self-diagnosed the flow of blood to the brain being impeded.  :-(

I live with it, and avoid bending my neck back, just as you do.
It is very definitely worse when the weather is cold and in a cold wind,
so I wrap up.      Applying warmth gives relief in two ways, reducing
the arthritic effect, and dilating the blood vessels.

Of course we know that bitterly cold weather is the time for strokes.

My long term fear is that I will experience what happened to my mother.
She suddenly went into spasmodic head movements which my sister and I
thought was a stroke, but the emergency doctor who came out called it a
spasm.   He looked thoughtful for a while, and then gave her an
injection, which stopped the spasms within a short time.

Our own GP came out next day, and almost blew his top when he heard what
had happened, saying that the injection should not have been given.
He then said "You should realise what you will now have to cope with".
He seemed to imply that it would have been better had she been allowed
to die.
He was right, there was brain damage, and my sister had a hell of a time
with her for some 10 months.    I was there when I could, but I was
working and had a wife and young children.    I would go in the evening
and tell Sis to get out of the house for a few hours, but she used to
say that if she did - she would not come back.  I understood
that........

We tried everything to get her into a Geriatric hospital, to no avail.
It was finally resolved, with my sister at the end of her tether, when
the doctor and a district nurse were there, and my sister showed them
the timetable of tablets she had to dispense, and declared it impossible
to fit them all in and get any sleep.

The doc picked the bottles up one at a time, reviewed what they did with
the nurse, and removed all but the water tablets and some which were "to
keep her quiet" (Instead of her wandering out the door in her nightie!).

The nurse firmly told me that I should sleep in the house that night,
which I did, to find that my mother had died peacefully in her sleep. 
If I follow the same path I hope that it will be done sooner!

Not sure to what he refers to as Garner's job.  It does seem to indicate a
speedy resolution.

Oh well, I've been wrong before.

My close friend was in his 50s when he had bad problems with his back.
He was unable to get in and out of his car without severe pain, and
unable to lift the ladders out of the car boot to do his job as a
surveyor.

His company paid BUPA for him, so he went to a specialist.
The outcome was that he was told that he needed an operation which would
give him only a 50% chance of being able to walk.   The company said
that if he wanted to get back to work . . . . .

So he had the op, and was able to walk, but has to 'throw' his foot,
like John Thaw did, but for a different reason.

He had to have a company car which was automatic and with plenty of
headroom.    He got that, then they offered him early retirement soon
after, I suspect because he was not doing as many surveys as the younger
guys.   ;-) 

He has all kinds of skeletal/ nerve problems which can't be diagnosed,
so has had a spinal tap, which crippled him for a week, and he is only
slowly recovering.

We are hoping for good news but . . .

My high blood pressure is a relatively new development too - in the last
couple of years.  I remember one exam, a loooong time ago, when the
nurse tried three different sphigmomometers (sp?) before she would
believe my BP was 90/60.  I have a minor problem with my heart, but
nothing like yours.  I hope the medication helps.

The next time you're looking for a video, see if they have "City of
Angels".  If you like Nicholas Cage, you'll love the movie.

I watched moist-eyed tonight as Concorde was seen taking off from
Manchester Airport for it's last flight.

A magnificent sight, as she took off like a beautiful but hook-nosed
bird, never destined to make huge profits for the airlines, but what an
engineering achievement.      The only supersonic airliner built, as
others were abandoned, and an Anglo-French achievement of which I am
proud . . . .

The sight of those four afterburners winking as she disappeared into the
haze was awesome.  Apparently all the approach roads to the airport were
jammed as people flocked to see her.

I flocked to the TV....

Oh yes, she married and moved away, selling the house to a property
developer and making a killing.    She's a bit eccentric, has had many
dogs over the years, including at one time six Shiatsus.
Wears strange clothes......   :-)

She had a stroke several years ago but almost completely recovered
except for slow speech, which is a blessing really.  <g>

Thanks for explaining Northern Exposure, Joy.
The first time I heard Northern Exposure was when I was
asleep on the sofa with the TV on. All of a sudden, even
in my sleepy state, I knew I was listening to some
outstanding dialogue. I was hooked from then on.
I especially liked the actors who played the young doctor
and his sometime girlfriend, the one with the cute face
and the short hair. I also enjoyed the laconic character who
served as the doctor's receptionist.
As for the dangers of moose, you gave a perfect example
of what I was talking about.

I've washed dishes in cold soapy water while camping
and I've lived to tell about it. I think the important thing
is to rinse them well. I wash dishes and pots every day
without rubber gloves. I use reasonably hot water.
My hands are soft and unaffected by the soap and water.
I use a detergent called "Dawn".
I do make use of the dishwasher as well. It all depends
on how many dishes need to be washed.

I have just watched the President of the United States of America
address the Australian Parliament.
In fairness I must say that it is the best speech I have ever heard
him make.   Which leads me to wonder whether the cutting by  the media
and the presentation of 'snippets' of political speeches, really
reflects the actual content of the them.  Taking perhaps much of it
out of context.   This time I saw it as it was happening....
The Opposition did not wear white armbands but chose to present a
letter to Mr Bush.
Two senators did interject and were removed from the House by the
seargent at arms....they  returned  after the speech finished  and Mr
Bush was shaking hands with various senators....they were ejected a
second time.
Mr Bush did receive a standing ovation - but I personally think it was
an off-the-cuff remark that gave him the edge.  During the second
interjection he grinned and said...."I love free speech"...... this
remark was met with a most enthusiastic and spontaneous  round of
applause and one could almost feel the tension in the house relax.
Whether you approve of him or not....he undeniably acquitted himself
well.
 The content was neither more nor less than was expected dealing as it
did with the war in Iraq, the fight against terrorism and the long and
historic association between Australia and the US.
A nice touch was the naming of the SAS Sergeant who was killed in
Afghanistan and the announcement that he would be laying a wreath in
his honour this afternoon.

Just thought you would like to get an Australian point of view...

I certainly appreciate this view, Jingles.  Of course all his speeches
are written for him.  He probably has a team of writers, and some of
them write better speeches than others.  His speeches definitely
approved after the September 11 attacks.  I suspect a number of factors
were involved.  In the past, I don't think he particularly cared if he
got a word or two wrong, which resulted in some pretty funny bloopers.
All of a sudden, things were dead serious, and he decided to pay
attention.  Also, someone suggested that his speech writers learned to
modify the speeches according to his normal vocabulary, rather than
throwing in a lot of words he isn't comfortable using.  At any rate, I'm
glad he acquitted himself well while away from home.

Does anyone remember Ivy Benson and Her "All Girl Band" which ran for
over 40 years, from 1939 to 1982 and had 250+ girl musicians passing
through over that period. They played on Radio during the War Years,
toured in Europe and the Middle East and many will remember the Summer
Seasons at the Villa Marina Gardens on the Isle of Man in the late
50's/early 60's, when up to 6000 visitors would relax in their
deckchairs to listen to an afternoon of excellent musical
entertainment.

Ivy passed away in May 1993 in Clacton on Sea where she had retired.

Little of the history of this unique UK band has been available, but I
have now developed a website to celebrate them. I am always looking
for stories, photos and memorabilia connected to this band - can you
help? You can see the site at www.ivybenson-online.com  - I hope you
enjoy it and maybe I will hear from you.

Picked this up in a newsletter

     IN AN EFFORT TO HELP OUTSIDERS UNDERSTAND THE MIDWEST UNITED
     STATES, THE FOLLOWING LIST WILL BE HANDED TO EACH DRIVER
     ENTERING THE AREA:

     1. That farm boy standing next to the feed bin did more work
     before breakfast than you do all week at the gym.
     2. It's called a 'gravel road'. No matter how slow you drive,
     you're going to get dust on your SUV. I have a four-wheel drive
     because I need it. Drive it or get it out of the way.
     3. We all started hunting and fishing when we were seven years
     old. Yeah, we saw Bambi. We got over it.
     4. Any references to "corn fed" when talking about our women
     will get you whipped... by our women.
     5. Go ahead and bring your $600 Orvis Fly Rod. Don't cry to us
     if a flathead catfish breaks it off at the handle. We have a
     name for those little trout you fish for...bait.
     6. Pull your pants up. You look like an idiot.
     7. If that cell phone rings while a bunch of mallards are
     making approach, we will shoot it. You might hope you don't
     have it up to your ear at the time.
     8. That's right. Whiskey is only two bucks. We can buy a fifth
     for what you paid in the airport for one drink.
     9. No, there's no "Vegetarian Special" on the menu. Order a
     steak. Order it rare. Or, you can order the Chef's Salad and
     pick off the two pounds of ham and turkey.
     10. You can bring Coke into my house but it better be brown,
     wet, and served over ice.
     11. So you have a sixty-thousand dollar car you drive on
     weekends. We're real impressed. We have quarter of a million
     dollar combines that we use two weeks a year.
     12. Let's get this straight. We have one stoplight in town. We
     stop when it's red. We may even stop when it's yellow.
     13. Our women hunt, fish, and drive trucks - because they want
     to. So, you're a feminist. Isn't that cute.
     14. Yeah, we eat catfish. Carp, too - and turtle. You really
     want sushi and caviar? It's available at the bait shop.
     15. They are pigs. That's what they smell like. Get over it.
     Don't like it? Interstate 70, 80 & 90 go two ways. Interstate
     29, 35, & 75 go the other two. Pick one and use it accordingly.
     16. The "Opener" refers to the first day of deer season. It's a
     religious holiday. You can get breakfast at the church.
     17. So every person in every pickup waves. It's called being
     friendly. Understand the concept?
     18. Yeah, we have golf courses. Don't hit the ball into the
     water hazard. It spooks the fish.
     19. That Highway Patrol Officer that just pulled you over for
     driving like an idiot, his name is, "Sir"... no matter how old
     he is.

     Now, enjoy your visit and go home.

Geeze you liberals, how 'bout cutting us a little slack.  Your =
complaints about President Bush's speech can be applied to all =
presidents at least in the modern era.  We (conservatives) know how you =
feel about any of us, but don't make it so obvious, ok.

Your imagination and intelligence is not showing.

Oh Well..........

As he pulled out the hanky, his keys came out with it, and dropped down

He may have misunderstood this from you:

It is small, plump bird, with a black 'cap' and a yellow breast which

This is true.  We had our reformation.  Islam has not...yet.  However, this

There was once an agricultural salesman who, when driving down a rural road,
noticed a chicken pacing him at about 40 mph.  He sped up to 60 and the
chicken stayed with him.  Then, the chicken sped up and left him in the
dust.

A bit later, the chicken turned into a farm.  The salesman, thinking "This I
gotta see.", followed the chicken.

He pulled up to the farmer who was in the front yard and said, "Man, that's
gotta be the fastest chicken I ever saw".

The farmer replied, "Yep.  I've developed a four legged chicken.  I figured
that, since everybody loves drumsticks, they'd fetch a premium price."

The salesman asked, "How do they taste?

The farmer replied, "I dunno.  I've never been able to catch one."

jingles - I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate your kind and
objective desciption of Bush's speech in Australia.
Bush does have a lot of dissent , including in our own country here, as
well as in yours, and all across Europe.  Whether his policies are good
or not will probably be debated until long after he is gone.  I have
mixed feelings about it, but am NOT one of the Bush bashers.
Incidentally, he does have a very nice, quick, spontaneous sense of
humor.  He is not a very good speaker, but his prepared speeches are, of
course, someone else's writing, and his thoughts.==It is so refreshing
to run into someone (you!) who is able to take a step back, and arrive
at a fair judgement.
Olly

jingles,

I would never be foolish enough to enter into a dispute with the
'godmother' of this group. You're too precious.

As Bush, however, was making his "I love freedom of speech!" remark, it
should noted that the person speaking out against him was being
physcially removed from the hall.

Don't lose any sleep over it, Jingles.    After trying to explain to him
how he might have misunderstood you, I received an insulting email from

Never been called 'godmother' before...but quite a number of other
things....some quite uncomplimentary.....but I have survived....
The word 'precious' has many meanings....the one I prefer is
'valuable' but I think I may be flattering myself if I take this to be
your intention.

To interject when a member of Parliament has the floor is a
discourtesy...regardless of  who the speaker is or who the interjector
is.... it calls primarily for a warning....and subsequently the member
is removed from the Chamber.
The President was a guest of the House and he had the floor....the
same courtesy should have been extended to him .. as would be extended
to anybody else.
It is permitted to state one's case in the correct manner....and at
the appropriate time....once the Speaker of the House recognises the
member .  If there were no rules of behaviour the place would be
bedlam with everybody yelling and nobody listening.  
Senator Bob Brown was in the wrong behaving as he did....it was a
discourteous act.   He could have submitted his  'unhappiness' to the
President in a letter as did the Leader of the Opposition, but of
course he wouldn't have got the TV coverage.
Yes! there were demonstrations.....the War in Iraq is not
popular....my post simply covered the President's speech which was
well delivered... not the Policies of the US.
As I said before....credit where credit is due.....he performed in an
admirable fashion....and carried off the interjection with aplomb that
won  him a round of applause....Finish!

Yes!  as I said we had a full coverage from the House.   Bob Brown had
made his intentions know that he was seeking the release of the two
Australian residents who are being held in custody....the wife of one
of them was also present in the House....a second Senator endeavoured
to force a letter on the President while he was shaking hands I
understand it was from the wife of one of the prisoners.....
It was also noted by the press that a number of Senators did not rise
to their feet for the standing ovation....but did applaud.

I remember her as part of my youth.  It always intrigued me that it
was an 'all girls' band as all the other big bands were male.
I don't remember the name of the film,  but they did make one....and I
did see it...
jingles - also about to take a peek at her youth....

Poor devil doesn't get the chance. His 'friend' is the 87 year old who is as
jealous as hell of anyone she thinks is getting 'too friendly' with him.
It's so sad. Bill says take no notice of her.
He's a lovely chap, tall ex RN and you can just see him in his officers
uniform. He is so interesting to listen to. What Sylvia doesn't realise is
that no one has any designs on the man, he is just part of the group.

Sorry to disagree but they do not sound the same at all.
I can usually tell whom is singing before it is announce.
Listening to the 3 Tenors singing at one of their concerts I don't need to
look to know which one is singing. Of course
I like classical music better than the modern music, which
usually does sound all the same to me. <g>
I have a pretty catholic taste in music and still enjoy the Stones and other
60s groups as well as brass bands, pipes, and sloppy songs from earlier
years.

The only time I saw her was on the I.O.M. in the 50s.
There was a parade on the sea front and the band was leading it, I'm afraid
we were all singing 'Livin' Doll' although we did stop to watch them. ;-)

I have lurked on this group for about 10 weeks.  You were very rude to
Rod you belittled him. He writes about one thing You deliberately talk
about the weather. It didn't look like Christian rhetoric to me he
replied to someone else. He didn't leave ignominiously! He left making
you look like an  ill mannered oaf.

I tried to listen to the sound of the bird here,
but my computer wouldn't let me. I got a
message saying the "RealOne Player could
not locate the specified clip."
Is anyone out there able to access the sound clip
at the second URL above? The link says:

I'm happy to be able to say that our son rode on
the Concorde last year. His Scottish girlfriend had
to attend a wedding in Europe and invited him along.
They had only the weekend and took the Concorde back
to the USA. I believe they used her extra flight points,
or whatever they're called. She flies quite a bit on business,
earning "free" travel this way. We might meet her Scottish
father during the Thanksgiving holiday. I can't wait.
BTW, this little lass has a pilot's license and took my
husband for a flight last year. They rented a plane in CT.
I just watched. <g>
---Sea, in the USA, who never flies...

I smashed on last night - by accident, one of my MIL's old ones.   Still
got two others, but I hope that was the cracked one!

I Quote him:
*********************************************************************
I am a Christian. Jesus said I have come to fulfil the testament not
to destroy it. He must blush and hide at what we do in His name.. The
ten commandants say thou shalt not kill. I am puking   at what is
being done in the name of the Lord. Rod

I am a Christian. Jesus said I have come to fulfil the testament not
to destroy it. He must blush and hide at what we do in His name.. The
ten commandants say thou shalt not kill. When we kill not because we
are threatened but because somebody might do something we turn away
from the teachings of the Christians with pre-emptive war.People who
do that are foul criminals  No amount of fancy words or stupid logic
will stop me from puking. I am puking   at what is being done in the
name of the Lord. Rod
********************************************************************

He is, apparently, thrice 'puking'.   8-)

I rest my case.......

>He didn't leave ignominiously! He left making
>you look like an  ill mannered oaf.
>
No - he proved himself to be one, I reluctantly quote his email to me,
which, quite apart from the lack of punctuation, and coupled with the
extraordinary burst of rhetoric above, shows him to be a strange fellow
in my humble opinion!

He wrote:
**********************************
I am ashamed to know you are English You are rude your plan B shows me
you are a true dickhead Rod
**********************************

Now a word of advice.
It is always a mistake to open your contribution to a newsgroup, as both
you and 'Rod' did, by starting an argument and insulting people.

Both of you have insulted me, but I have carefully kept my opinion of
you to myself.

Please learn from my example!

Teddy,
I am sorry I have to correct you,  but Rod announced his withdrawal
from the group in response to my post ..... in which I saw nothing
offensive.

Don't know for sure of course, but I suspect that Rod and Teddy is the same
troll.

That is OK.  They/he/she are/is welcome as far as I am concerned.

I suspect that's true of most reporting.  There's limited time and sometimes
one's own opinions are part of the selection, not necessarily purposeful.

In point of fact, most of the reporting about the war on terror suffers from
a media problem.  It is not, I think, so very much any media bias, but the
nature of the news.  A thousand schools open on the same day a bomb
explodes.  Which gets covered?   Sensationalism sells newspapers and gets
ratings for news programs.

 This time I saw it as it was happening....

Jeanette - no, it is something other than "testy" - - I would guess that
Gordon sees "contentious" as being any statement which differs from his
political views.==Olly
**********************************************
Contend =  to strive in debate; argue; maintain, assert.
Testy - easily annoyed; irritable; marked impatience or ill humor:
exasparated;  see also,irascible which means:  to become angry,, be
angry; marked by hot temper and easily provoked.  

So I don't think what you said Gordon meant (above) is what he sees.

I never flew on her, but I went inside a fuselage at the naval Air
Museum at Yeovil.   It al seemed very narrow compared with even the
Boeing 737, but outside she was a beauty!

The last take-off returning from NY was even more spectacular, with the
engines pouring flame in the night sky.
The end of an era, and we may never see supersonic passenger flight
again in our lifetimes.

You have absolutely nothing to apologise for jingles.
Although I haven't felt like posting for the last couple of weeks or so, I
still have been having a nosey and you have
been the lady in all your replies.

( apart from the sugestive ones to Mike & Gordon
 of course.  ;-) I don't know what they did for the fellows
but they cheered me up.)

Suggestive ones?

Mike?

Thank you for your reassurances  my friend.  As we get older we
sometimes wonder if we are losing our ability to communicate clearly
with our fellow man.  Our hearing diminishes as does our
eyesight....it is only natural that our powers of communication should
also suffer..  Old age is, I fear, something to be endured rather than
enjoyed.... <grin>
(I am glad I cheered you up though....<grin>)

Neither did I, in what either you or Gordon said.  This reminds me very
much of what happened recently in another newsgroup.  Some strangers
popped in and bandied words about, then one of them supposedly took
offense and an innocent, if silly, joke.  When people tried to
remonstrate, he became offensive and his friends jumped in to attack.
He concluded by threatening to destroy the group, and even bragged about
his plan to do so on another group.  We haven't heard from him or his
friends since.  When trolls are ignored for long enough, they decide it
isn't any fun and go looking for someone else to torment.

Jingles,
Testing a new sig file and passing on another description of the
speech which I found on a UK group.  Any comments? I left your
original in for comparison.
By Kathy Marks in Sydney
24 October 2003


President George Bush was jeered and heckled yesterday during an
address to the Australian parliament, in which he thanked the nation
for its support in the war against Iraq.

President Bush defended the American-led military action, claiming it
was vindicated by the discovery in Iraq of secret biological
laboratories and design work on prohibited long-range missiles.

He said: "America, Australia and other nations acted in Iraq to remove
a grave and gathering danger, instead of wishing and waiting while
tragedy drew closer."

Mr Bush hailed the Australian people for helping the US to "advance
the ideals of democracy and freedom".

The people, though, were unable to hear him deliver those compliments
unless they switched on their television sets. As part of a massive
security operation to protect Mr Bush, they were shut out of
Parliament House for the first time in the country's history.

With the public gallery closed, the job of expressing the anti-war
sentiments of a substantial minority of Australians fell to two
maverick senators, Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle. The pair, both members
of the Green Party, were ejected from the chamber. Interrupted by them
for the second time, Mr Bush said, smiling between gritted teeth: "I
love free speech."

Australia, which has fought alongside the US in every war of the past
century, was one of the few countries to send troops to Iraq. Mr Bush
praised the "bravery and skill" of its military, and described John
Howard, the Prime Minister, as "a leader of except-ional courage".

Mr Howard saluted "the character and the strength and the leadership
of the man we welcome today". Among those listening to the mutual
backslapping was Ahmed Habib, 18, whose father, Mamdouh, is one of two
Australians detained in the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. Mr Habib, in parliament as a guest of the Greens, was also
thrown out, after shouting: "Hey Bush, what about my dad?"

Only 2,000 or so demonstrators turned up, and they were kept 100 yards
away, almost out of earshot.

They were given permission to use microphones, but only if they
pointed the speakers away from the building. Inside, most people
listened politely and clapped- even opposition MPs, who had threatened
to turn their backs on the President.

Mr Bush, who spent just 20 hours in Australia, his final stop on a
whirlwind tour of Asia, added: "The terrorists cannot be appeased.
They must be found, and they must be fought, and they must be
defeated."

It was the responsibility of the Australian Government to take
appropriate action to protect the person of the President of the
United States....
A complete coverage was provided live on television....

I would have hardley described it as between 
'gritted teeth'  his words and actions earned him a round of applause.

Although I watched and listened to the entire coverage, I confess that
I did not hear this interjection......this does not mean that it did
not occur....

I am not a troll and I am nort Rod.  I do have a  Hotmail adress so
does Rod so do a 150 million others.  You are all defending bad
maners. It is rude and insulting to answer someone by talking about
something different.  It  like the weapons of mass destruction debate.

I suggest that Gordon stop insulting others and  then turn around when
he&#8217;s are called on it and pretending he&#8217;s  the offended
party. We have better manners in our Philadelphia schoolyards. He
shouts about Rod&#8217;s Christian beliefs but is okay for him to tell
the Anglican church what to do. He thinks he is free to make sexual
innuendoes I suggest that you learn from me if you are going to insult
others don&#8217;t expect to be immune.

English Fair Play is a fine expression. It justifies the bashing of
the puny draper's assistant by the big hairy blacksmith, and this to
the perfect satisfaction of both parties, if they are worthy of the
name of Englishman.
Joseph Furphy. 

Gordon should rest his pompous case somewhere else. His plan B sucks
is rude plain rude. How would you like it if your posts were answered
with my dinner menu or the Philadelphia weather?

BTW Concorde's Last Flight was Friday October 24 2003.  Manchester,
Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh are only part of the tour
of Britain. He should at least get the facts straight if he
can&#8217;t get his manners right

One of Arthur Askey's silly little songs was about a wriggly worm.
Jingles remembers it, she has a memory like an elephant; but there the
similarity ends I hasten to add (for protection). <grin>

Stating that illegals come over here to have their babies on "Medicare".
I've never heard of a woman having a baby while on Medicare.
It would be highly publicized, don't you think?
I'm not saying it's impossible, but strange.
I think you meant "Medicaid".  And, yes it frosts me, that so many
illegals can have their babies in the U.S. and get away with it,going on
to have more "free" babies. (To them anyway!)  Jeanette

The sight of those four afterburners winking as she disappeared into the

I, like thousands of others, would have loved to fly on Concorde, but like
those others, could never have afforded it.
I might as well give up doing the lottery now. My only consolation is that I
have seen all the Concorde aircraft apart from one of the French ones. A sad
day indeed.  :-(

Jingles - - you forgot that, when we get old, we may wear purple!!  What
could be more inspirational than that!!
Talk about inspirational!!.  My son came to  visit; told me he can
hardly ever reach me, since I am always on the web.  My web is connected
so that, when in use, the telephone will not work.  Well, since all my
friends are gone, that suits me fine; does not bother me.
He (my son) said, let me take a look at those groups where you
participate , to see whether they are as interesting as you told me!!!
(Checking up on dear old Mom??!!) I said:"fine."  Turned ,to begin with,
before turning to the other groups I occasionally join,  to
alt.sixtplus, and - lo and behold - the topic was :"I want to puke."
Hundreds of titles, all stating:"I want to puke."  He looked at me in
utter disbelief - and said, turn the darn thing off - how could you!!!
Let's talk."
Well, we did talk,and I "explained" to him what some of the attractions
might be in belonging to a newsgroup (s), despite the charming title of
"I want to puke.!"

How many British Prime Ministers have been the victims of assassination,
and how many attempts.   I can only remember one - the Brighton bombing
attempt on Maggie Thatcher.

How many American presidents?  Lincoln, Kennedy......?

In which country were they assassinated.

Ahh!  There's the rub!  have any been killed on foreign soil?

Wouldn't dare let my son look at the posts on sixtyplus.....he would
think I was depraved.....(which I would like to be, but lack
opportunities).   He thinks his mum is a dear old lady who sits with
her 'tatting' and occasionally reads a not too 'naughty' book....
Why must they assume that our interests and thoughts age,  just
because our bodies do?
The only compensation is the thought that he  too will grow old  and
cop the same 'flak' <grin>.

My biological clock never seems to adjust to the time changes.....
This morning I awoke and looked at the clock  and there it was 7.15am.
and everybody knows I rise at 6.15am.   
Last night husband was busily going around changing the time on all
the clocks a time consuming (ha! ha!) task.   My solution would be to
stick post-it notes on all the clocks announcing that they were an
hour slow.....this would only last for six months of the year, then
you could go round and pull them all off again.  Much quicker and
easier than changing the clocks twice a year....
But do you think my husband sees the sense in the suggestion?  Nah!

Free speech can be interpreted more than one way, in which case somebody
has to decide which interpretation applies in a particular case.  I
would hope that in the United States we would show the same courtesy to
a guest speaker from another country, allowing the guest the freedom of
finishing his (or her) speech without interruption.  There are many
forums in both our countries for protesters to speak freely.  I say,
onya! to those who decided our President (misguided though he may be)
should be allowed to finish his speech.

Clotted cream isn't like whipped cream.  It is somewhere between whipped
cream and butter.  It has more density than whipped cream, but not as
much as butter.

When our Prime Minister visited America he was given a cordial welcome
by the President and hosted graciously.  His speech was listened to
with a courteous attention and he received a standing ovation.
The least we can do as Australians when hosting the President of the
United State is behave accordingly.
Protestors were not denied their right to protest....they assembled in
the streets...that they were kept at a distance from the President was
as it should be in the light of some of the behaviour that was seen on
the TV coverage.....

Both Cornwall and Devon are famed for this delicacy. Traditionally
this is made by pouring milk into shallow pans and leaving,
undisturbed, for 24 hours allowing the cream to rise. Double cream can
be used instead.

Serves 4-6

Unhomogenised whole milk or double cream - 600 ml (1 pint)

METHOD

Pour milk or cream into a shallow pan. If using milk leave undisturbed
for 24 hours.

Heat the pan, gently, to about 82 C (180 F) and hold at this
temperature for approximately 1 hour.

When the surface cream has developed a thick, rich, yellow wrinkled
crust, Turn off the heat and allow the pans to cool slowly.

Once cold, skim the cream off and serve with scones, fruit or fruit
pies.

Encore!  Encore!

I'm thinking of my Ozzie friends tonight, remembering the terrible fires
that were burning there not so long ago.  We are having fires in
Southern California, and I found out a little while ago that if I walk
out along the side of my house, I can see flames in the hills.  They are
somewhat distant, but mobile homes were burned less than 10 miles from
me, and places much closer have been evacuated.  I can smell smoke, even
inside my house with doors and windows closed.

Praises be...I began to fear the world had come to an end and nobody
had told me....<grin>  Then again you could all have been having a
party and not invited me....that was a thought too....<grin>

I saw the news coverage of the fires over there....it said they were
burning  to the outskirts of Los Angeles....and it was difficult to
get them under contol.   Bush fires are a frightening thing even when
viewed from a distance Joy....
I cannot believe that people who are burned out actually rebuild and
go on with their lives in the same place....they must be a very
special kind of person,  I couldn't do it.  In fact I won't buy a
house that faces any rise of bush fire.....that is how scared I am of
fire.
Anyway I hope you are well and the only problem you have is with the
smell....
It has been very quiet online today....guess it is all the clock
changing that has to be done....quit exhausting when you consider the
number of clocks we have around the place.  I wish I could find one of
those old fashioned alarm clocks that you wind up each night.....I
think I would dump the rest and carry that around the house with me...
Nice talking to you Joy....but I think I will go and make a cuppa and
settle for some TV viewing...
Goodnight to you...

Spencer Perceval assassinated in the lobby of the HoC
in 1812. John Bellingham was hanged within the week.
Think there were a couple of attempts on other PMs but can't remember off

The fires rage on.  My power was off twice during the night and once
this afternoon, so I thought I'd check in while I have power.

The smoke is getting pretty bad.  I'm still a long way from any
evacuation area, but the situation doesn't look good.  Between Ventura
County, where I am, and the other areas in California that are having
fires, 208,000 acres have been burned and 500 homes have been destroyed.
Several people have died.  There have been 80,000 acres destroyed in
Ventura County, and both freeways leading into the valley have been
closed.  There are other ways out, but they are bound to be crowded.

The wind is blowing pretty hard, and the sky is gray with smoke.  I have
my battery operated radio on in case of another power failure.  My
daughter has said I can bring my cats and stay with her if I want to,
but so far I'm sticking it out.  If we get an evacuation warning or I
start having an asthma attack, I'll load up the cats and try to get
there.  Otherwise, I'll stay here.

I hope I'm making sense.

I don't think I've ever had whipped unsalted butter, so I can't say.

Jingles,
Did you make those lyrics up? Excellent!
I've noticed that the newsgroup has been slower
than usual. I drop by and see nothing that I can
respond to. I have an idea for another thread.
I'll try it out now.

ROLL CALL!
A few years ago on another message board,
I remember we used to have "Roll Calls".
Posters would jump in and let us know they were
still around and would tell a bit about themselves.
So... how about it? Let's do it!
As for me, I'm from New York State in the USA.
DH and I retired back in 1991. We moved from
downstate NY to an upstate NY resort area in the
Adirondack Mountains. We found a cottage in the
boonies with a view of Lake George & the mountains.
After 12 years of living in the sticks, I realized that
I'm a city gal. (lol) So this summer, we bought a house
nearer to civilization (45 minutes south), keeping the
cottage as a summer camp. We're still getting settled
and adjusting to our new lifestyle. 'Tain't easy, but
somebody's gotta do it. (g)
How about you?

What a grand idea! I'm from the USA and have
never heard of Ivy Benson, but I think you've
done a good thing bringing back old memories.
Some quotes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Sooner or later we all discover that the important
 moments in life are not the advertised ones, not
 the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not
 the great goals achieved. The real milestones are
 less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory."
-Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) US social reformer, suffragist

"I have liked remembering almost as much as I have liked living."
-William Maxwell, Essay: "Nearing 90", NYTimes Magazine, 3/9/97.
(William Maxwell was a fiction editor
 at "The New Yorker " Magazine for 40 years.)
 This is one of my favorite quotes.

Thanks, Sea.  I'm still a lot better off than a lot of people.  I have
newsgroup friends who have had to evacuate themselves, and others who
have relatives who have been evacuated.

I don't think I could stand the tension of evacuating
my home. But, like everything else in life, I suppose
that when we're faced with an emergency, all of our
inner resources are put to the test.
Someone gave me good advice years ago.
I was reminded that we should try to have faith in our
abilities to face whatever challenges are put before us.
However, I hope I never have to face this kind of
tragedy. I'm not sure my inner resources are strong
enough to pass the test.

Hi Sea -  I am getting a lot of approval lately....<grin> the words
just came to me as I sat in front of my empty screen trying to decide
what to do with the rest of my time...
I noticed you hadn't been around as much as usual....do you think with
the approach of winter all the posters have gone into hibernation?
Tim should be back in the not too distant future,  but at the moment
she has a number of things which are taking up her time....
You are correct of course about retirement.....every day is
Saturday....I have a friend who get very cross because retirees don't
get Public Holidays.....he has a point .....
Better fly,  I have a doctor's appointment in 30 minutes...

I think the Net develops a lot of problems at the weekend?  I know
that if I'm going to have problems, that's when they turn up!

As for posting, well I've been in bed since Wednesday with the
mother and father of all colds!  I only get a cold once a decade,
for which I'm more than thankful, but when I _do_ get one.......!

Hi Jingles,
There's nothing like approval to perk up our spirits. <g>
I'm not sure what happened to all the posters.
You'd think there would be more of them, since the
cold weather keeps us indoors more.
DH & I have been occupied with household chores and
repairs lately. I've been running to the store to buy
sandpaper and paintbrushes. Thrilling! LOL
The hardware store is another world with another
language altogether. I never knew there were so many
kinds of sandpaper and paintbrushes.
I was told by "150 grit" sandpaper. I found two kinds,
both marked "150 grit", but one was coarser than the
other. Of course I was skilled at testing coarseness
because we women have to deal  with nail files all our
lives. Experience counts. LOL

Hi Joy,
Sorry to hear that things are so bad.....don't be too brave,  pack up
those cats and go stay with your daughter.
The last newspaper report was 200 homes destroyed but we know that
this figure can escalate rapidly when the bushfires are out of
control.
If you get this message, know that my thoughts are with you...take
care...

Not a bad idea Sea...
I'm pretty well known I suppose....but...
I am a Brit who took the ten pound cruise over 50 years ago and have
never regretted it.
Spent the first 50 years in Melbourne....the 'big smoke' but a couple
of years ago we took the plunge and moved to a large country town
about 100 miles from Melbourne.
We have all the facilities we need and a laid back lifestyle among
people with a strong community spirit and the time to say 'Hi' when
you pass in the street.
Loving it of course.

Jingles,
Why do they call it the Melbourne 'big smoke'?
And what is the significance of "the ten pound cruise"?
I already know you're in Australia, but perhaps some
people don't realize where Melbourne is.
I know that's hard for you to believe (g), but it's possible.
At this point in my life's memory, I hear familiar names
of places, but sometimes I have no idea where they
are. Somehow, my reference memory isn't as good
as it used to be. Perhaps that's true of others?

Thank you, Jingles.  Most of the homes that were destroyed were from
other fires, about a hundred miles from me.  There were a few that were
destroyed closer to me, but not many.  To tell the truth, there are two
main reasons I haven't packed up and driven to my daughter's house
already.  First is the overwhelming task of figuring out what to take,
and packing it.  The second is the fact that I have two cats and so does
my daughter.  The thought of four miserable cats makes the idea of going
there rather unattractive.  My daughter's cats are strictly indoor cats,
while mine are indoor/outdoor.  I'd probably have to keep them shut in
one room, which would not be fun.  If I have to do it, I will, but I
haven't reached that point yet.

I am making lists of what I would want to take, and I located my fire
insurance policy and put it out, ready to grab.  Other than that, I'm in
a holding pattern right now.  If we have another power failure after it
gets dark, which it will in a couple of hours or less, I'll probably
decide to go.  Of course, if that happens, I'll wish I'd gone sooner.  I
may do some packing in a while, just in case.

When I was a kid, I couldn't wait to be grown up so I could make my own
decisions.  Now I'd give anything if I didn't have to make some of those
decisions!

Joy

Joy, how awful for you. Get the essentials packed and leave them in the car.
Get the cats inside the house and their carriers to hand and get ready to
go. Rather two unhappy cats short term than two dead ones. Good luck, I'll
keep my fingers X

I'm a newly retired school psych examiner, and former English and
social studies teacher, in Kansas City, MO.  I live with two adult
children and a barely adult grandchild, and two cats.   Till recently
I thought I was going to live with a male Texan friend in Texas,  but
he got religion and moved to a nunnery- well, Chirch of Christ
retirement house- instead.  We're currently on let's be friends penpal
status.  My daughter may move where a job calls her (she's a Ph.D.
psychologist) and my grandson may go away to college next school year.

Jan,
Well, now I know where Melbourne is.
But I've never heard of Melton. (g)
Is it in Florida? (lol) (See Dink's post re Melbourne.)

OK; how about this....

I was born September, 9, 1934 in Beckham County, Oklahoma near the small town of
Erick. I am the youngest of three children. All born during those bad old days
referred to as the depression. To the credit of my parents I was never aware
that those days were bad. 

My family moved to Medina County, Texas in my first years and opened a small
country store near Devine, Texas. I grew up there attending a small country
school, Shook School, and later I went to the big city high school of Devine,
1500 people, from which I graduated. Much to the surprise of my English
teachers. 

Made bread at a bakery in San Antonio, Texas and sold Dr Pepper drinks for a
while before joining the United States Air Force in February 1953. My intentions
were to be a pilot but physical limitations dictated otherwise. However I made
good use of the training I got in electronics which served me very well for the
next twenty-five years or so. 

I left the Air Force in 1957 and worked a short time for Chance Vought Aircraft,
Braniff International Airways. Both no longer in existence. I then started to
work for the United States Weather Bureau, later the National Weather Service,
and worked there for the next 21 years as an Electronic Technician. I got a
chance to retire early from the Weather Service in 1979 and I took it. 

I then worked for the Xerox Corporation for twelve years until they could not
put up with me any more. Wouldn't quit, Wouldn't resign, Wouldn't retire; so
they fired me. :-) ( Not so sad. I was fully vested.) Since then I have taken
full advantage of being retired and working only where and when I wanted to.
Temporary agencies, driving a shuttle bus at the airport. IBM for a while until
one day they said we would be working every day for a month. I said I wasn't and
that was that. 

I  worked half-time for the Austin State School . In many ways it is the best
job I have ever had. Austin State School is a facility for the mentally
retarded. I was surprised at how attached I  became to the men and women that
reside there. Their needs are great and are appreciative of the simple action of
shaking hands when you greet them. I retired there in 1999.  I still  visit some
of the friends I made there.


After reitring from The Austin State School I did nothing for a year.  I then
began part time work with the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impared as
a Weekends Home Escort.  The school sends the students home each weekend, if
they wish to go.  I work the San Antonio route.  I, with two others, ride along
to make sure the students do not misbehave, keep them entertained  and help them
when we make a rest stop.  I make the trip twice a week.  Usually on a Friday
when we take them home and on Sunday when we return them to school.   The entire
trip, to San Antonio and back, takes about five hours which is idea for me. 

I  married to the beautiful Rosa Lee 43 years ago. One son ( The computer guru
of the family ) and am  I am sixty-nine years old. 


Retired; National Weather Service, United States Air Force Reserve, Xerox
Corporation and the Texas Mental Health and Mental Retardation Agency. 


I spend too much time on newsgroups such as alt.penpals.forty-plus-yrs,
alt.fifty-plus.friends, alt.sixtyplus, alt.misc.friends, alt.config,
alt.how.to.create.a.newsgroup and alt.sci.natural.phenomena.unusual .  But it is
fun. :-)

You are probably right....the kids are off school and I am sure they
make the most of the time.
Sorry to hear you have been sick,  I hope you are feeling better now.
Looking forward to seeing more of your posts now you are on your feet

Wouldn't hurt to put your main essentials in a bag Joy....to be on the

matter to grab the bag.   You can always unpack them when the danger

'The Big Smoke' is a term generally used for the big cities.
Melbourne is the capital of Victoria,  that is the little State just
as the bottom end of Australia...<grin>
The 'ten pound cruise' was again a term used to describe the trip to
Australia by British Migrants.  It cost them  ten pounds,  but they
had to stay in Australia for two years or repay the fare out and the
fare back to the UK.
Another term was 'Ten quid tourists' <grin>

OK! you're hired......(just joking)  an interesting life you have had
Eugene.....
It is amazing how no matter what we do for a living, it is usually the
job we do with the most vulnerable which rates the highest.  I had a
number of jobs which could be called 'high profile' but the one I
loved most was my final one when I was the secretary/bursar of a
Primary School.  I comforted many a little kid who was away from his
mother for the first time,  and provided many a pair of dry pants from
my special cupboard for littlies who were too nervous to ask to go to
the toilet....For several years after I retired,  I would be
surprised, while out shoppin,  to get a hug from some High School
student that I had known as a 'prep'.

Thanks, Jingles.  Things are looking better now.  The fire has moved
east, and the wind has died down.  If the wind stays low long enough,
the firefighters might be able to gain some control.

"Drugs threaten US trade deal
By Roy Eccleston and John Kerin
October 27, 2003

A NEW row over Australia's national cheap drug scheme is threatening
efforts to clinch a US free trade deal by the Christmas deadline.

As officials from both nations hold talks in Canberra this week, The
Australian has also learned the latest offer by US negotiators would
mean up to 80per cent of American farm produce would be off- limits to
Australian competition in the first year. 

The offer - which would open up only one-fifth of US primary industry
- would mean sensitive areas such as beef, sugar and dairy were
off-limits. Australia's $5billion-a-year Pharmaceutical Benefits
Scheme provides subsidised drugs to consumers at affordable prices,
but it is under attack from the powerful US drug company lobby because
the industry claims it depresses the prices. 

US President George W. Bush also raised concerns with John Howard
during talks in Canberra on Thursday about the political difficulties
he faces in the US over perceptions drug prices are too low in
Australia. 

But he has instructed US negotiators to get a deal by the end of the
year. 

Any relaxing of restrictions on the approval and pricing process for
the $4billion-a-year subsidised drugs scheme is politically sensitive
for the Prime Minister because it would mean higher drug prices for
Australian consumers. US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick has
referred to Australia's PBS as a "pharmaceutical protection system",
signalling the US wants changes. 

He has also expressed concern about Australia's quarantine system and
restrictions on foreign investment. 

"(We have) issues dealing with foreign investment, dealing with
cultural carve-out, dealing with (Australia's) pharmaceutical
protection system as well as a series of market access issues," Mr
Zoellick said at the APEC summit in Bangkok last week.

But Health Minister Tony Abbott said yesterday the PBS would not be
negotiated away in a free trade agreement. 

"The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will not be a bargaining chip in
these negotiations and frankly, it shouldn't be, because the (PBS)
does not discriminate between overseas and locally produced drugs," Mr
Abbott said. 

"It is not a trade instrument ... it is an instrument for ensuring
that Australians get reasonable access to affordable drugs." 

Trade Minister Mark Vaile maintained the US had only formally
registered concerns about delays in getting products approved for the
Australian market, rather than the structure of the scheme. 

Mr Zoellick also revealed in Bangkok last week that the US did not
propose an immediate major increase in market access for Australian
farmers. 

He said under the latest US offer on agriculture - already described
as inadequate by the Howard Government - lamb and "some 21per cent of
our products" would have protection eliminated in the first year. But
Australian officials pointed out lamb had virtually no tariff now in
the US - and the comment suggested that almost 80per cent of American
farm products would initially retain existing levels of protection. 

Mr Zoellick did not say which products were in the 21per cent. But
they are almost certainly not the sensitive areas like beef, dairy,
sugar and cotton. 

For those, it appears the US would phase in increased access for
Australian products over years - possibly up to a decade or more. 

Trade negotiators from the US and Australia hold their penultimate
meeting in Canberra this week and the offers from both sides have been
kept from public view. 

Mr Vaile said yesterday there was a better than 50per cent chance of
negotiating an agreement by Christmas, but Australia needed to ensure
it was locked in before the US was distracted by domestic issues in
the lead-up to an election. 

The Australian"

I always prefer to buy surprise presents for my SO when I see something
suitable, rather than search in vain at birthdays, and as for Christmas
- Yuck!    Flowers are more expensive on Mothers Day and at Christmas.
Of course, I come unstuck sometimes - last time I bought two bunches of
flowers for M**** she asked "What are these for?   What have you been up

As we get older, our memories usually fill our lives more fully that new

Good advice, Jingles..."live for today".
Sometimes we spend time worrying instead
of enjoying the moment we're in.
It sounds like simple advice, but it has great
meaning.

Trouble is that everyone has been dropping by and writing nothing, and
when that happens the group is empty.

Conversation between 3 blokes:

Where have you been?  I drop in the pub most evenings at 7 and it's been
empty.

I call in EVERY night at 8 oclock and nobody's there. 

I was there from 7:15 to 7:45 for the last two weeks and I didn't see
either of you......

Thanks for the bio, Eugene.
Nice to know more about you.
I see we're the same age and both had 2
siblings. I was the "middle child" in family of
three girls. I've always lived in New York State.
I taught elementary school for 5 years before
I was married and substituted for 12 years while
raising a family. I also worked in special education
as a teacher's aide for 4 years. It was steadier
than substituting. As Jingles suggested, working
with young children can be very rewarding.
After our 4 boys grew up, I left teaching and went
into the business world, working as a pension
payment coordinator in the finance department
of a pension fund. I don't regret the change of
profession because it expanded my horizons,
as I'm sure all your changes expanded yours.

I think so.   Panic measures don't help, but do not hesitate if you get
the official warnings either, too many have died already.
We have seen some terrifying pictures, and I hope the wind dies and the
weather changes real soon, Joy.      There is a high price sometimes for
living in idyllic places, but there has been some extraordinary weather
this last few years.
Hang in there.

You would remember her, and her band, if you had been a GI stationed
in the UK during WW2............Talk about flies round a jam pot!! In
fact, many of her band married GI's and went back to America with
them. She was constantly having to look for replacement players.

This is very good Jingles. I was prompted to have a go myself aimed at
certain posters who have recently appeared, but I had to scrap it as a
bit too strong.<g> It began:

Are you loathsome tonight,
Do you post lots of..........

Good people all, of every sort,
Give ear unto my song;
And if you find it wondrous short,
It cannot hold you long.

In Islington there was a man,
Of whom the world might say
That still a godly race he ran,
Whene'er he went to pray.

A kind and gentle heart he had,
To comfort friends and foes;
The naked every day he clad,
When he put on his clothes.

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound,
And curs of low degree.

This dog and man at first were friends;
But when a pique began,
The dog, to gain some private ends,
Went mad and bit the man.

Around from all the neighbouring streets
The wondering neighbours ran,
And swore the dog had lost his wits,
To bite so good a man.

The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye;
And while they swore the dog was mad,
They swore the man would die.

But soon a wonder came to light,
That showed the rogues they lied:
The man recovered of the bite,
The dog it was that died.

	-- Oliver Goldsmith

LOL! "Flies around a jam pot" !
That's a cute expression.
That's the first time I've heard it put that way.
We usually say "Moths around a flame".

I have the last two lines of that Kipling poem
engraved on a dish on my shelf.
("Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware
  Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.")
I found it in an antique store. It was the first time
I had ever seen those lines.
The poem asks why we have dogs.
My answer: Because they bring us love, and
even more important, they evoke love from us.

We also say "Moths around a flame" when appropriate, but it sounds
rather terminal! We say "Flies around a jam pot" when it better suits

Yes, there's definitely a difference in the
connotations of the two sayings. LOL
I like the "jam pot" better than the "flame". <g>

Proudly showing off his new apartment to a couple of his
friends late one night, a drunk led the way to his bedroom
where there was a big brass gong.

"What's that big brass gong for?" one of the guests asked.

"It's not a gong.  It's a talking clock," the drunk replied.

"A talking clock?  Seriously?" asked his astonished friend.

"Yup," replied the drunk.

"How's it work?" the second guest asked, squinting at it.

"Watch," the man said.  He picked up a hammer, gave it an
ear shattering pound and stepped back. The three stood
looking at one another for a moment.

Suddenly, someone on the other side of the wall screamed,
"For god sake, you asshole.. it's ten past three in the
morning!"

Thank you, Gordon.  I would have left if I'd been given an official
warning, but I wasn't.  The fire has now moved east of me, and is moving
south through largely unpopulated areas.  The wind is not as bad as it
was yesterday, so there is hope that this particular fire can be stopped
before it destroys any more homes.  There are others in the area called
the Inland Empire and in San Diego County that have done a lot more
damage and are still a danger.

A couple were invited to a swanky family masked fancy dress Halloween party.
The wife got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party
alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she
was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there was no need for his
good time to be spoiled by not going.

So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after sleeping soundly
for about an hour, woke without pain and as it was still early, decided to
go to the party. As her husband didn't know what her costume was, she
thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he 
acted when she was not with him.

So she joined the party and soon spotted her husband in his costume,
cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice "chick" 
he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His 
wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left 
his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her. She let him 
go as far as he wished, naturally, since he was her husband.

After more drinks he finally he whispered a little proposition in her 
ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had passionate
intercourse in the back seat. Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped
away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what
kind of explanation he would make up for his outrageous behavior. She was
sitting up reading when he came in, so she asked what kind of time he had.

"Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not
there." Then she asked, "Did you dance much?"

He replied, "I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there,
I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the spare room
and played poker all evening."

"You must have looked really silly wearing that costume playing poker all
night!" she said with caustic sarcasm.

To which the husband replied, "Actually, I gave my costume to your Dad, and
apparently he had the time of his life."

Marty wakes up at home with a huge hangover.

He forces himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees
are a couple of aspirins and a glass of water on the side table.

He sits down and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean 
and pressed. Marty looks around the room and sees that it is in 
perfect order, spotless, clean. So's the rest of the house.

He takes the aspirins and notices a note on the table, reading
"Honey, breakfast is on the stove.
I left early to go shopping.
Love you!"

He goes to the kitchen and sure enough, there is a hot breakfast 
and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating.

Marty asks, "Son, what happened last night?"

His son says, "Well, you came home after 3 a.m., drunk and delirious.
Broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and gave yourself a black
eye when you stumbled into the door."

Confused, Marty asks, "So, why is everything in order and so clean,
and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?"

His son replies, "Oh, that! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when
she tried to take your pants off, you yelled, 'Lady, leave me alone,
I'm a married man'!"

85 years of age, Morris married Lou Anne, a lovely 25 year old.

Since her new husband is so old, Lou Anne decides that after their
wedding she and Morris should have separate bedrooms because she is
concerned that her new, but aged husband may overexert himself if they
spend the entire night together.

After the wedding festivities, Lou Anne prepares herself for bed and
the expected "knock" on the door. Sure enough the knock comes, the door
opens and there is Morris, her 85 year old groom ready for action.

They unite as one.

All goes well. Morris takes leave of his bride, and she prepares to
go to sleep. After a few minutes, Lou Anne hears another knock on her
bedroom door, and it's Morris.

Again he is ready for more "action." Somewhat surprised, Lou Anne
consents to more coupling. When the newlyweds are done, Morris kisses
his bride, bids her a fond goodnight and leaves.

She is set to go to sleep again, but Morris is back again, rapping on
the door, and is as fresh as a 25 year old ready for more "action."

Once again they enjoy each other. But, as Morris is set to leave again,
his young bride says to him, "I am thoroughly impressed that at your
age you can perform so well and so often. I have been with guys less
than a third your age who were only good once. You are truly a great
lover, Morris."

Morris, somewhat embarrassed, turns to Lou Anne and says: "You mean,
I was here already?"

A man with no arms walks into a bar and asks for a beer.
The bartender shoves the foamy mug in front of him.

"Look," says the customer, "I have no arms.  Would you
please hold the glass up to my mouth?"

"Sure," said the bartender, and he did.

"Now," said the customer, "I wonder if you'd be so kind as
to get my handkerchief from my pocket and wipe the foam off
my mouth?"

"Certainly."  And it was done.

"If you reach into my right hand pants pocket, you'll find
the money for the beer."

The bartender got it.

"You've been very kind," said the customer.  "There's just
one more thing - where's the men's room?"

"Out the door," said the bartender, "turn left, walk two
blocks, and there's a filling station on the corner."

The Indians asked their Chief in autumn if the winter was
going to be cold or not.  Not really knowing the answer, the
chief replies that the winter was going to be cold, and that
the members of the village were to collect wood to be
prepared for a cold winter.

Being a good leader, he then went to the next phone booth
and called the National Weather Service and asked, "Is this
winter to be cold?"

The man on the phone responded, "This winter was going to be
quite cold indeed."

So the Chief went back to speed up his people to collect
even more wood to be prepared.  A week later he called the
National Weather Service again, "Is it going to be a very
cold winter?"

"Yes", the man replied, "it's going to be a very cold
winter."  So the Chief goes back to his people and orders
them to go and find every scrap of wood they can find.

Two weeks later he calls the National Weather Service again
"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very
cold?"

"Absolutely, we made a study " the weather man replies, "the
Indians are collecting wood like crazy!"

I don't think Elvis wrote the original - or any song, as far as I know.

It was the two bunches that made her suspicious.  That was overkill.
